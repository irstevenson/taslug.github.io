<p>Hi All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>As software freedom day rapidly approaches (16th Sept, Wesley Church Hall in Melville St., Hobart), I thought I&#39;d put in an update. So far the displays are:<br &#47;><br &#47;>OpenOffice.org dedicated display<br &#47;>Some cool XGL eye-candy<br &#47;>Linux on low-end hardware (DSL running very nicely on a very old machine)<br &#47;>A box running "that other OS" showcasing some F&#47;LOSS.<br &#47;>A competition machine (woohoo win prizes!).<br &#47;>Some cool games running on some machines for people to play on.<br &#47;>MythTV display.<br &#47;>A Distro&#47;software machine for burning CDs<br &#47;>A CD full of cool f&#47;loss windows games for sale.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Does anyone else have anything they&#39;d like to display or would anyone like to volunteer to help out on the day? Please contact us soon!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Also I&#39;ve been spruiking the day on Edge Radio (did an interview last Friday) and I&#39;ll be on ABC local on the day. Hopefully we&#39;ll get a heap of people there!<br &#47;><br &#47;>There are other teams in most other parts of the state too (Launceston, Devonport, Queenstown and Penguin) so check out their info <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.softwarefreedomday.org&#47;teams&#47;oceania&#47;au">HERE<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Ben.</p>
