<p>Hello LUGgers!<br &#47;><br &#47;>It's May! That means... Winter is Coming... It's time for TasLUG's annual state-wide meetup in Ross. It's a great time where warriors defending the wall in the North, and houses from Kings Landing come together to defeat the Wildlings... no wait...<br &#47;><br &#47;>WHEN: Saturday 24th May 2014, 10am to 6pm<br &#47;>WHERE: Ross Town Hall <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;maps&#47;place&#47;12+Bridge+St&#47;@-42.0313673,147.4923442,19z&#47;data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xaa71aeaa0d364fed:0x1387c8a4b1d95e58" target="_blank">map link<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>This is a great opportunity for those who have come to TasLUG in the past to take a drive in the country to the idyllic town of Ross and meet up with those on the other side of the state.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Bring your FOSS gear - PCs or embedded stuff that you've been working on. Bring what makes you log on to your Linux machines each day and tell us all about it. For those who have given a presentation to either the Hobart or Launceston meetings in the past 12 months, you may be called upon to give an encore performance to tell the rest of the state what you've been up to.<br &#47;><br &#47;>At the meetup we will also be opening nominations for positions on the TasLUG committee for the next year, so here's your chance to get involved to keep TasLUG going, and to meet people from across the state who would like to help out.<br &#47;><br &#47;>There will also be some time set aside for discussion of upcoming events - GovHack (June), Openstack Birthday Meetup (July), and Software Freedom Day (August). We would like many of you to get involved as there's some organising to do and we need your ideas!<br &#47;><br &#47;>There will be tea and coffee available at the venue. The laid back atmosphere means you could also take some time out exploring the town and it's charms - there are some eclectic antique stores nearby (no vintage PCs though!), and perhaps get some lunch at the local pub.<br &#47;>Hope to see many of you there!!<br &#47;><br &#47;>There is no Hobart meetup this month to encourage as many as possible to make it instead to this statewide meetup. If you need a lift out there, get in contact with us - you could try the TasLUG mailing list (<a href="mailto:taslug-chat@taslug.scriptforge.org">taslug-chat@taslug.scriptforge.org<&#47;a>) or our IRC channel (#taslug on Freenode) to help find someone to give you a ride.<br &#47;></p>
