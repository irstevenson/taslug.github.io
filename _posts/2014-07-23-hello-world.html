<p>Today we replace the old site which was dying a painful horrible death. We actually planned to do this in a month or two after some more planning but a recent PHP upgrade by the old provider broke the CMS the old site was hosted on and data was leaking out like a sieve.</p>
<p>We have a backup of the old side and will shortly find a way to import all the old posts into this new site.</p>
<p>Until then we have a rather plain and uninteresting site. Wordpress is a nice modern CMS &#47; blogging platform that has enough features to keep the site interesting and access to many many plugins that allow us to extend the site with new features.</p>
