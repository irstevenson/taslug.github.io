We're taking a break from our normal programming to bring you something a
little different. Chatbots seem to be the new hotness, so let's take a deep
dive and create our own. Bring your laptop, grab a beer and let's code up a
leaky buggy chatbot for our IRC channel, GNUSocial or the old facebook page.


  * The pad for adding notes, links, tech support stuff, etc is here:https://pad.taslug.org.au/p/may-chatbot-hackfest


  * If you can't make it, keep an eye on the EtherPad which has a chat feature and the IRC channel to help out.


## When: Thursday 19th May from 6pm

## Where: Hotel SoHo, Davey St, Hobart

## Agenda:

  * 6pm - Arrive, set up, grab a drink, start hacking

## Coming up

  * May 28th - Launceston meeting
  * June - Nothing planned - contact @[faulteh](https://scriptforge.org/user/1 "Scott Bragg" ) if you have a talk!
