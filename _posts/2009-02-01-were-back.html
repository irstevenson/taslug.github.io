<p>So sorry everyone, but of course these things never go smoothly.  TasLUG was offline for around 48 hours, but as a consequence, it&#39;s provided an excuse to get everything sorted out in one go.<br &#47;><br &#47;>So we&#39;ve now got full ownership of all our web resources, all the domain redirects are sorted out, and so we should have a much more stable service from here on in.<br &#47;><br &#47;>As a result, we have also resurrected the mailing list, though we couldn&#39;t get access to the old membership list in time to import everyone.  So if you&#39;d like to join the TasLUG Chat email list, please go here: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lists.taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;mailman&#47;listinfo&#47;taslug_lists.taslug.scriptforge.org">http:&#47;&#47;lists.taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;mailman&#47;listinfo&#47;taslug_lists.taslug.scriptforge.org<&#47;a> and register.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Leah.</p>
