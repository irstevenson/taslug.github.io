<p>Just a quick note for any of you who have been [d]wasting[&#47;d] spending time on Facebook lately - there is now a TasLUG group.  You can find it at: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;group.php?gid=4587934723">http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;group.php?gid=4587934723<&#47;a> (NB: you need to be a member of Facebook to use this link directly - if you&#39;re not a member you can always join up but we&#39;ll cross post anything important over here too :-)).<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Leah.</p>
