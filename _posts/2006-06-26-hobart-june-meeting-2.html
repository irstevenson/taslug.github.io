<p>Hi All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>The TasLUG June meeting will be held on the Thursday 29th June 7:30pm, upstairs at Bridie O&#39;Reilly&#39;s. <br &#47;><br &#47;>I&#39;ll be giving a presentation on IP, the FTA and competition (I promise it won&#39;t be too lawyery :) ) and answer some questions on IP and the FTA. We&#39;ll also have some updates on the LCA2008 bid and software freedom day and our usual q &amp; a sessions.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Ben (IANAL &#8230;.. yet)</p>
