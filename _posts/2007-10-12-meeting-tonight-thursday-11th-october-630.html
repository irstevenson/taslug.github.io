<p>Just to bump this to the front page&#8230;.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Apologies for the late and very short notice, the website host has been down for over two days, which includes our mailing list, so we have had no way to contact everyone!<br &#47;><br &#47;>There will be a social meet for TasLUG tonight, Thursday 11th October at 6:30 pm at the Maypole Hotel.  We&#39;re going to be discussing the future direction of TasLUG statewide with TasLUG North, as well as general Linux&#39;y chat.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Table is booked under TasLUG, but you should be able to find us - we&#39;ll be the ones with the Penguin. ;-)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Hope to see you there.</p>
