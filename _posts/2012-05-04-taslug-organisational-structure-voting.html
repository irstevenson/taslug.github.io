<p>G&#39;day everyone<br &#47;><br &#47;>You may recall that we were planning to have a vote on the future direction of TasLUG at the state-wide gathering. After discussion, we decided to assemble a steering committee to help guide us through that process.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The first task of this steering committee has been to put together a document that outlines the pros and cons of each of the three options before us. That document can be found in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;modules&#47;newbb&#47;viewtopic.php?topic_id=230&amp;forum=3">our forums<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The voting period has been stretched out till the 13th of May, and the voting form can still be found <a href="https:&#47;&#47;docs.google.com&#47;spreadsheet&#47;viewform?formkey=dFR6S0VacGJlOGRmMTg3c0t4bVQyU1E6MQ">here<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br &#47;>(note: if you tick either of the boxes saying you&#39;d like to be involved in helping run things at a local or state level and choose to not put any contact details in, you&#39;ll need to make sure you keep track of updates yourself as we get closer to formalising things)</p>
