<p>Hi All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Sorry its taken me a while to write the report from SFD!<br &#47;><br &#47;>SFD was a very successful day with around 80 attendees. As usual the most popular display was the OpenOffice display, however XGL impressed everybody. The most suprisingly popular machine was the ancient box run up with FreeDOS - I think people appreciated the nostalgia value!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Radio talkback was popular with many calls about F&#47;LOSS. We gave away a heap of CDs via the radio show as well.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The showbags and competitions went down well too. Winners will be announced at the next TasLUG meeting.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Photos of the event are <br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.softwarefreedomday.org&#47;gallery&#47;2006&#47;gallery&#47;2006&#47;oceania&#47;au&#47;Hobart">HERE<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>There&#39;s a writeup of the Launceston event that can be found <a href="http:&#47;&#47;softwarefreedomday.org&#47;teams&#47;oceania&#47;au&#47;launceston">HERE<&#47;a></p>
