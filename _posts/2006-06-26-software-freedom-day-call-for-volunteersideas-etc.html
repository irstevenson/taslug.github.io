<p>Hi All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Software freedom day is on again this year on September 16th. I&#39;ve registered a team from Hobart and submitted a request for materials from SFD international. We&#39;ll probably do a similar event to last year - an expo with displays and the like as it was very popular last year. I&#39;ve opened up a thread in the suggestion box for any ideas, offers of help etc.<br &#47;><br &#47;>It&#39;d be good if we could get a team together from the North as well so we could have a truly Statewide SFD  - you can register a team <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.softwarefreedomday.org&#47;">here (SFD international)<&#47;a>. Make sure you request your materials ASAP as there are limited supplies and this year&#39;s SFD looks bigger than ever. Last year Australia registered the most teams of any country, let&#39;s see if Tassie can register the most teams of any state :)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Ben.</p>
