<p>Welcome to our many new TasLUGgers (and associated visitors)! ;-)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Thanks for dropping by. I know some of you are trying to contact us, rest assured any (many) emails sent to contact@marchsouth.org and volunteers@marchsouth.org are being read, and will get responses as we have answers for you.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Interested volunteers are being placed on a list, and we will be in contact shortly; other requests - well, we&#39;re working on it!  You&#39;ll hear back from us soon.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Our conf images will also become available in due course.  We are currently finalising the licencing on these, so they can be passed around, printed, stuck on walls, etc.  We&#39;ll make it public as soon as they&#39;re ready to go.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Leah.</p>
