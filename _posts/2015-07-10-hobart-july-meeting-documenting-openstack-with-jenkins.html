<p>Hi LUGgers,</p>
<p>It's July, so it's great that we have Julius giving us an OpenStacky related talk since July is also the 5th birthday of the project. So come along, grab a schnitzel, beer and let's talk documentation!</p>
<p><strong>When<&#47;strong>: Thursday 16th July 2015 from 6pm.</p>
<p><strong>Where<&#47;strong>: Hotel SOHO, 124 Davey St, Hobart<br />
(it seems we've been ursurped from our downstairs room by a LEGO group that meets weekly, so it's probable that we will be upstairs again. Watch out for a sign or ask the friendly bar staff as you order a drink!).</p>
<h2><strong>Agenda<&#47;strong><&#47;h2><br />
6pm-7pm - Arrive, mingle, chat, setup, grab beers and food.<br />
7:00pm - Documenting OpenStack with Jenkins - by Julius Roberts</p>
<pre>"..Jenkins is a robot and the first word he learned was No.  Followed<br />
by No, No, No, and then No.  Meeting Jenkins and taming him is a walk<br />
through git (the preeminent distributed revision control system) and<br />
Gerrit, a free, web-based team code collaboration tool.  Using these<br />
things a team of developers can create and manage any distributed<br />
codebase, including markdown for documentation, puppet manifests or<br />
your kernel module.  And when Jenkins says "yes", magic things<br />
happen.."</p>
<p><&#47;pre><br />
8.30pm - Meeting close</p>
<h2><em><strong>Coming up soon:<&#47;strong><&#47;em><&#47;h2><br />
August -- your talk here?</p>
