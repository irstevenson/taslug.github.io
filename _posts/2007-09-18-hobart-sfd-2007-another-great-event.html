<p>After sleeping off a weekend of lost sleep, lost flyers, and lost voices, I&#39;ve finally made it here to report another great SFD event.  Hobart weather managed to hold out despite forecasts to the contrary, and brought 60-70 people through the doors to learn more about the many different faces of FOSS software.<br &#47;><br &#47;>It was heartening to see how many of our attendees already had a good working knowledge of the software available; the growing awareness and enthusiasm about great applications such as OpenOffice, the Mozilla suite, and the GIMP was fantastic to see.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Many thanks to Joel for helping us promote our event on the ABC, and to Ben and Michael for doing an amazing job under pressure - and of course to everyone who dropped in to help us celebrate those wonderful people who produce the software that we know and love so well.</p>
