Our April meeting in Hobart is fast approaching. With a renaissance on
electronic kit building, and proliferation of software defined radios, this
month I'm going to be bringing along some of my radio gear to demo some of the
ways Linux and Amateur radio cross paths. However any other hams are welcome
to come along with some gear and add their demo. I'll also give a rundown of
what it takes to get or upgrade your license.


### When: Thursday 21 April, from 6pm

### Where: Hotel SoHO, Davey St, Hobart
