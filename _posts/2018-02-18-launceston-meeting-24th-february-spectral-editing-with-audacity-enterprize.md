Hi people! For this month's Launceston meeting, we will look at the new(ish)

allow for a more visual way of analysing and editing unwanted sounds in audio
recordings.


 **Where**

**When**
Saturday 24th February
2:00pm Start

As always, everybody is welcome to come along and join the discussion. Hope to
see you there!
