<p>Hi All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>An impromptu dinner has been arranged at Hotel SOHO (124 Davey St, Hobart) at 7pm, for anyone who would like to join us and have an informal chat with Brenda Wallace of LinuxChix fame, who is joining us after presenting a miniconf talk on memcached last week.<br &#47;><br &#47;>(Apologies for the late notice, it was only finalised 5 minutes ago!)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Leah</p>
