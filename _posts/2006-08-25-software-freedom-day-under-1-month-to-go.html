<p>Hi All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Just a quick update on SFD (16&#47;9). The venue for Hobart&#39;s event will be the Wesely Church hall (56 Melville St, Hobart). We&#39;ll have giveaways,  interactive displays, competitions and prizes - so it should be a fun day for all!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Other events around the State will be held in Launceston, Penguin, Devonport (Mersey Bluff BBQ area) and Queenstown (Queenstown Online Access Centre. Driffield Street). Check out <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.softwarefreedomday.org&#47;teams&#47;oceania&#47;au">the SFD website<&#47;a> for more details of events in your area.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I&#39;ll be doing a F&#47;LOSS talkback on ABC local radio from 10am on the day - so you can call in with your F&#47;LOSS questions!<br &#47;><br &#47;>If you have any suggestions for the events there&#39;s a thread in the forum for your suggestions.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Ben.</p>
