<p>Hi all,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Unfortunately our bid to host LCA2008 was unsuccessful, however Melbourne will undoubtably put on a great conf in 2008!<br &#47;><br &#47;>I reckon we&#39;ll be putting in a bid for 2009 to bring LCA to Tassie, so get thinking about what sort of things we can do. <br &#47;><br &#47;>Thanks go to the Hobart bid team for all their hard work and a special mention must go to Allison Williams from the Tas Conventions Bureau who gave us so much help in putting together the bid.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Now its on to putting on a fantastic SFD and with 4 teams registered in Tassie, its looking pretty big!<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>Here&#39;s the repost of the announcement from the LA list:<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
<blockquote>Congratulations to Donna Benjamin and Team Mel8ourne! In 2008<br &#47;>linux.conf.au will return to the city where CALU kicked off the whole<br &#47;>LCA phenomenon.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The decision this year was really tough with very well presented bids<br &#47;>from both Melbourne and Hobart. Both proposals contained a lot of flair,<br &#47;>and Hobart as a potential destination was definitely a big drawcard for<br &#47;>many people. In the end though the LA Committee felt that the Melbourne<br &#47;>team&#39;s plans were more well developed, and with Donna&#39;s enthusiasm and<br &#47;>organisational ability there is no doubt that they will pull off an<br &#47;>absolutely awesome conference in 2008.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The Mel8ourne website is at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mel8ourne.org&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.mel8ourne.org&#47;<&#47;a><&#47;blockquote></p>
