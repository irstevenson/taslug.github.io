<p>Hi all,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Since we had such a brilliant presentation earlier in the month, our regularly scheduled TasLUG April meeting (27th April) will be a quiet affair. A social gathering at the Bridie O&#39;reilly pub for a few quiet drinks, a bit of discussion about the LCA2008 bid and, of course, any questions about Linux :). So, 7:30pm Bridie O&#39;reilly&#39;s pub (main bar) on Thurs 27th April.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Ben<br &#47;><br &#47;>Ps. we&#39;re trying to organise another special presentation for our May meeting - stay tuned!</p>
