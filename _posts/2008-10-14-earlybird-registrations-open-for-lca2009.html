<p>linux.conf.au announces earlybird ticket sales<br &#47;><br &#47;>Organisers of linux.conf.au, Australia&#39;s prestigious Linux conference, today announced that earlybird tickets have gone on sale for the January Conference. These substantially discounted tickets will be available until November 3rd 2008 or until sold out.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Tickets can be purchased from the conference website.<br &#47;><br &#47;>"Considering that last year&#39;s conference sold out pretty quickly, we expect a serious run on sales in the coming days," said Ben Powell, LCA organiser. "I&#39;d say to people that they&#39;ll probably want to get in quick, so they don&#39;t miss out!"<br &#47;><br &#47;>Accommodation, partner&#39;s programme, extra t-shirts and dinner tickets can also be purchased at registration time. "We have a selection of reasonably priced accommodation available for our delegates both in the university colleges and Wrest Point Casino," said Mr. Powell, "but again, I&#39;d get in quick as they&#39;ll fill up fast. Same with dinner tickets - you won&#39;t get a better banquet than then Penguin Dinner - and I&#39;m sure tickets to this great event will go quickly."<br &#47;><br &#47;>linux.conf.au, the National Linux Conference, will be held January 19-24 in Hobart at the University of Tasmania. More information about registration can be found at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.linux.conf.au">http:&#47;&#47;www.linux.conf.au<&#47;a></p>
