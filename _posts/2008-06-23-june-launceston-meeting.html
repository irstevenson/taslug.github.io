<p>Hi all<br &#47;><br &#47;>Apologies for the late announcement.<br &#47;><br &#47;>This month, I'll be doing a little talk that covers some open source image manipulation applications (HDR generation and tonemapping with qtpfsgui, panorama and image stitching with Hugin, and some basic touching up in the GIMP).<br &#47;><br &#47;>Afterwards, we'll have a look into what we can do for Software Freedom Day this year. We have a potential venue lined up and some good ideas to throw around.<br &#47;><br &#47;><b>2:00pm<br &#47;>28th June (Last Saturday of the month)<br &#47;>Royal Oak<br &#47;>Launceston<&#47;b><br &#47;><br &#47;>As before, a few of us will be gathering for a pre-meeting lunch downstairs at 1:00pm for anyone who's interested.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Look forward to seeing everyone who can make it!<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=cnr+Brisbane+St+and+tamar+st,+Launceston,+tasmania&sll=-41.439107,147.135751&sspn=0.007818,0.014591&ie=UTF8&ll=-41.433895,147.139442&spn=0.007818,0.014591&z=16&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Google maps link<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.softwarefreedomday.org" target="_blank">Software Freedom Day<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gimp.org" target="_blank">The GIMP<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;qtpfsgui.sourceforge.net&#47;" target="_blank">qtpfsgui<&#47;a><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;flickr.com&#47;groups&#47;qtpfsgui&#47;" target="_blank">qtpfsgui Flickr group<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;hugin.sourceforge.net&#47;" target="_blank">Hugin<&#47;a><br &#47;>Edit: Fixed the date - we aren't having the June meeting in May!</p>
