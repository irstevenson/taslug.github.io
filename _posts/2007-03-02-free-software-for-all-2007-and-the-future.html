<p>G&#39;day again everyone<br &#47;><br &#47;>What an event. I&#39;d say that within the first half hour, we had more people than we had at SFD last year. The turnout was amazing, and despite a couple of technical hitches, I think we pulled off a pretty well polished event.<br &#47;><br &#47;>There&#39;s a little report on the event on the site now that gives an overview of the day, and we&#39;ve thrown up the contents lists for the CDs we were handing out at the event. Copies of these can still be obtained by contacting us via the details on the site.<br &#47;><br &#47;>So far as what to do from here goes, we&#39;ve also updated the site with a couple of ideas of where we could go from here on the Outcomes page, and we&#39;d like to see what kind of demand there is out there in the community, so take a peek, drop us a line and we&#39;ll see what kind of responses we get.<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.freesoftwareforall.org&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.freesoftwareforall.org&#47;<&#47;a></p>
