<p>G&#39;day everyone<br &#47;><br &#47;>As mentioned last month, we have organised a small bus to travel from Launceston to Hobart for the linux.conf.au public Open Day. Open Day is a public exhibition where we hope to give a taste of the conference&#39;s highlights as well show off some fun and interesting things that people are doing with Free&#47;Open Source Software. More information will be available on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;linux.conf.au&#47;programme&#47;open_day">linux.conf.au website<&#47;a> soon.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>The trip will be free of charge, and will <strong>depart Launceston from the Birchalls carpark<&#47;strong> behind the Myer building. The bus will leave at <strong>8:00am on Saturday the 24th<&#47;strong>, and return the same afternoon at approximately <strong>5:00pm<&#47;strong>.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>There are a total of 11 seats available, and once they&#39;re full, we will not be able to take further passengers. If you are interested, please contact me, or post a reply in the following <a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;modules&#47;newbb&#47;viewtopic.php?topic_id=161&amp;forum=1">forum thread<&#47;a> so that we can get a feel for numbers.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>We are also hoping to man a Tasmanian Linux Users Group table at Open Day, as well as hold a round table discussion on what it&#39;s like to be a F&#47;OSS user and part of the F&#47;OSS community in rural and disparate environments.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>This is a great opportunity for those of us who are F&#47;OSS users in Tasmania to come together, share experiences and build our community.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I look forward to seeing everybody who can make it there!</p>
