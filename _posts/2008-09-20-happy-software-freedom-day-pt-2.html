<p>Please accept my sincerest apologies to all those FOSS enthusiasts out there, but our Software Freedom Day celebrations in Hobart today fell through. :-(<br &#47;><br &#47;>HOWEVER!  I have a whole stack of OpenCDs and Ubuntu CDs here, and I am happy to distribute these to anyone who might like one.  You can either:<br &#47;><br &#47;>Pick them up at our next meeting, which should be in the next couple of weeks, or<br &#47;>Drop me a line at taslug@gmail.com and I&#39;ll arrange to get the CDs out to you!<br &#47;><br &#47;>If you&#39;d like a couple to hand out to others, then that&#39;s OK too, just let me know - there&#39;s quite a few here&#8230;<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Leah.</p>
