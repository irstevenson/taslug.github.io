<p>Those who have nominated for positions on the council do a lot of hard work to promote FOSS and Linux in Australia, as well as organising premiere conferences such as LCA and PyCon-AU. It is great to see there are several Tasmanian nominations standing for a spot on the council such as Joshua Hesketh, Chris Neugerbauer and recent Tassie ex-pat Craige McWhirter.</p>
<p>TasLUG operates as a subcommittee of Linux Australia. Right now, voting has begun to form the 2015 Linux Australia Council. Membership to Linux Australia is also free, and I would like to encourage all those who turn up to TasLUG meetings to also become a member of Linux Australia.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.linux.org.au&#47;membership&#47;index.php?page=view-election&amp;id=21">https:&#47;&#47;www.linux.org.au&#47;membership&#47;index.php?page=view-election&amp;id=21 <&#47;a>and add your vote.</p>
