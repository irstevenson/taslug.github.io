February is upon us and so is this month's TasLUG meeting. Come along to Hotel
SoHo and listen to Peter Billam talk about learning the Lua programming
language. A Lua programmer walks into a bar. He brings his own table, which is
actually himself. Bring your tech support problems, gripes and rants and let
the hive mind try to nut out the answers.

  * 6:30pm - Peer Tech Support - have you tried turning it off and on?
