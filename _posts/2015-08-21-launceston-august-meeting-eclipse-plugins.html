  content: Hi there, I'm interested in replacing my Windows 8 OS on my laptop with
    a Linux OS. I'm not very computer savvy as I couldn't even get the Ubuntu live
    CD function to work. Is there anyone in Launceston you could recommend who would
    be capable of doing the job for me. I have tried a number of the computer shops
    but they are more interested in telling me that Linux would be a bad choice &amp;
    that I should upgrade to Windows 10. I'm having update problems with my Windows
    8 &amp; am really sick &amp; tired of Windows &amp; all the hassles &amp; problems
    it seems to have. I only use my computer for basic stuff &amp; simply don't need
    the masses of extras that come with Windows. The main programs I use are GIMP,
    Open Office, a Desktop RSS reader &amp; Firefox as my web browser. I had a talk
    with a guy from Linux Now in Melbourne this arvo plus what I've read online Linux
    seems like it would be a great alternative.

  content: "It sounds like Linux should be capable of doing what you're after!\r\n\r\nWithout
    knowing what hardware your laptop is running, it's hard to know what hurdles there
    might be, but if you're able to come along to the meeting mentioned in the post,
    we can probably find someone who can give you a hand."
