<p>Hi all, Just a quick update on some operational matters&#8230;<br &#47;><br &#47;>As many of you are probably aware, the mailing list has been down for some time. We have been trying to arrange to get this up and running again for a couple of months, but it appears this is not going to happen at any point soon.<br &#47;><br &#47;>However, it is possible to turn on notifications on the website so you receive new news stories as they are posted.  This is done by clicking on Edit Account (off to the left there&#8230;), ensuring Notifications is set to Email, and then going back to the home page and checking the Notification options at the bottom of the page.<br &#47;><br &#47;>You can also receive notifications of updates to forum threads in the same manner - go to the forums, and click the notification buttons at the bottom of the page.<br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;re hoping to rectify these problems in a few weeks (assuming we can manage to import the current site into a newer version of XOOPS) which should bring a shiny New Improved TasLUG 2.0 to you all&#8230; stay tuned!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Edit: Did we mention we have an RSS feed? The links are under XML (RSS Feed), in the menu over to the left there&#8230; ;-)</p>
