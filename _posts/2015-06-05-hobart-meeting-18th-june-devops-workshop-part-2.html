<p>This month we're continuing with the DevOps challenge that we started back in January. There's no talk this month but instead it's a collaborative workshop.</p>
<p>Pick a system configuration management tool &ndash; Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, &hellip;(any others?)&hellip; and at 6.30pm after we&rsquo;ve set up and ordered a drink we'll continue the tasks laid out on the website <a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;devops-challenge&#47;">here<&#47;a>. We've done the simple tasks last time which dealt with creating files, users and setting permissions, this time we'll be configuring services.</p>
<p>If you're already familiar with one config management tool you could try your hand at another and learn as you go.</p>
<p>After we finish the tasks, we&rsquo;ll bring up your solutions to the group on the big screen. This way we can take a look at how the same tasks are done with the different tools, and even the different approaches of doing the same thing with the same tool!</p>
<p>Bring your laptop with a virtual machine of a clean install of Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS or your favourite distro.</p>
<h2>Coming Up Soon<&#47;h2><br />
3-5 July - GovHack<br />
16 July - Julius Roberts talking about using Hiera with Puppet or maybe Git and Gerrit<br />
August - no talk organised - maybe you?</p>
<h2>Service Interruption - Mailing List<&#47;h2><br />
Between the 18th June and 30 June there will be some service interruptions to the TasLUG mailing list. Mailman 3.0 has been released and we will be migrating the lists still hosted at our old provider over to our other infrastructure. During this time your TasLUG-Chat mail may not get distributed, and&#47;or you may receive a couple of test emails coming through. I apologise in advance for any incidental testspam.</p>
