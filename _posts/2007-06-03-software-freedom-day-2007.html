<p>Hi all,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Well, it&#39;s that time again, Software Freedom Day 2007 has been announced, and Hobart will be hosting another event.  SFD 2007 will be held on Saturday 15th of September, and is a celebration of all things free and open source.  Software such as Firefox, OpenOffice, the GIMP (image manipulation program), Scribus, Battle for Wesnoth, and of course Linux, are all examples of free and open source software, and we will have plenty of CDs of FLOSS software to give away on the day.<br &#47;><br &#47;>In the meantime, we&#39;re looking for volunteers to help meet and greet people, or show off your favourite aspects of the free software world.<br &#47;><br &#47;>If you think you could spare an hour or two for SFD, or have some ideas about what you would like to see there, and what we should be showcasing,  please send us an email on the mailing list, in the forums, or at taslug@gmail.com.<br &#47;><br &#47;>More information at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.softwarefreedomday.org&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.softwarefreedomday.org&#47;<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>More Hobart-based information to come closer to the date - stay tuned!</p>
