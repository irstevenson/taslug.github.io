<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.howtoforge.com&#47;the_perfect_desktop_mandriva_2007_spring_free">This tutorial<&#47;a> shows how you can set up a Mandriva 2007 Spring Free (Mandriva 2007.1) desktop that is a full-fledged replacement for a Windows desktop, i.e. that has all the software that people need to do the things they do on their Windows desktops. The advantages are clear: you get a secure system without DRM restrictions that works even on old hardware, and the best thing is: all software comes free of charge.<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.howtoforge.com&#47;the_perfect_desktop_mandriva_2007_spring_free">http:&#47;&#47;www.howtoforge.com&#47;the_perfect_desktop_mandriva_2007_spring_free<&#47;a></p>
