<p>G&#39;day everyone<br &#47;><br &#47;>Just a quick note to let you all know that we&#39;re setting the 18th in stone as the date for a belated Software Freedom Day event in Hobart.<br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;re still waiting on confirmation for the venue, but wherever we end up at, we&#39;ll be gathering from 10:00am till 2:00pm.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Whilst the event is definitely going to be open to the public, we&#39;re hoping that everyone who can make it who uses open source software can bring something along to show off. Whether it be a tricky app you managed to get running, a nice hidden feature in Linux that makes your day easier, or even a spreadsheet you made in OpenOffice.org, chances are there&#39;s something you know or have done that can be of value to someone else.<br &#47;><br &#47;>At 12:00pm we&#39;re going to be doing a screening of Big Buck Bunny, the open source animated childrens short film sponsored by the Blender Foundation, as well as a few other F&#47;OSS related shorts.<br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;ve got a number of Linux distros burned off to disc that everyone is welcome to help themselves to and a few t-shirts and other goodies left over from Launceston&#39;s SFD event to hand out also.<br &#47;><br &#47;><strong>Saturday October 18th<br &#47;>10:00am till 2:00pm<br &#47;>Venue: TBA<&#47;strong> (check <a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;modules&#47;newbb&#47;viewtopic.php?topic_id=147&amp;forum=3">the forum<&#47;a> for updates)<br &#47;><br &#47;>There&#39;s a forum discussion going on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;modules&#47;newbb&#47;viewtopic.php?topic_id=147&amp;forum=3">here<&#47;a>. If you&#39;ve got any ideas or suggestions or just want to say you&#39;ll be showing up, join in.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Hope to see you all there!</p>
