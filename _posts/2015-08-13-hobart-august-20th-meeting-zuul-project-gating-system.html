<p>Hi LUGgers,</p>
<p>My apologies for not sending this out earlier in the month but I've been contaminated with some awful virus or plague or some deadly manflu.</p>
<p>This month I've persuaded Joshua Hesketh to give us the talk he recently gave at PyconAU about the Zuul project gating system. Zuul is a program that is used to gate the source code repository of a project so that changes are only merged if they pass tests.</p>
<p>It's a good follow-up to the Gerrit talk that came along last month. So I hope you brave the weather and meet us up at Hotel SoHo for a drink and a schnitzel and some FOSS development discussions!</p>
<p><strong>When<&#47;strong>: Thursday 20th August 2015 from 6pm.</p>
<p><strong>Where<&#47;strong>: Hotel SOHO, 124 Davey St, Hobart (probably upstairs)</p>
<h2><strong>Agenda<&#47;strong><&#47;h2><br />
6pm-7pm - Arrive, mingle, chat, setup, grab beers and food.<br />
7:00pm - Guarding the Gate with Zuul - by Joshua Hesketh<br />
8.30pm - Meeting close</p>
<h2><em><strong>Coming up soon:<&#47;strong><&#47;em><&#47;h2><br />
September - Ethereum - distributed computing, contracts and markets - Scott Bragg</p>
