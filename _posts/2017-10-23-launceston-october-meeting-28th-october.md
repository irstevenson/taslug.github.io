This month in Launceston following on from last monthâ€™s meeting we are going
to be talking about the types of open source tools that are available to use
in all aspects of game development. From planning and designing, to asset
development, coding, testing and deployment. Along the way we will look at
some of the implications of choice of tools, and how it may influence stages
further down the development pipeline.

As always, everybody is welcome to come along and join the discussion. Hope to
see you there!
