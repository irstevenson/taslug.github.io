<p>G&#39;day all<br &#47;><br &#47;>I&#39;m especially excited to announce that as discussed on the mailing list, forum and IRC channel, we&#39;re having a get-together in April on Saturday the 28th in the vageuly central location of Ross. This is a chance for people from all around the state to come together and get to know&#47;share knowledge with other Free&#47;Open Source Software enthusiasts. People are welcome to bring along a machine or a laptop or a mobile device or whatever&#39;s applicable to share with the community the sort of things they do.<br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;re also taking this opportunity to sit down and vote on a future drection for TasLUG as an organisation.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The schedule we&#39;re looking at for the gathering is:<br &#47;><br &#47;><strong>Saturday April 28th<br &#47;>Ross Town Hall<&#47;strong><br &#47;>* 12:00pm - 2:00pm: <em>Mill around, get to know each other, show off any gear&#47;projects we may have brought with us<&#47;em><br &#47;>*  2:00pm - 3:30pm: Meeting (<em>covering voting on an organisational structure for TasLUG, maybe discussing SFD 2012 and anything else that gets raised<&#47;em>)<br &#47;>*  3:30pm - 4:00pm: <em>Pack up<&#47;em><br &#47;>*  4:00pm onwards: <em>Go home&#47;BBQ&#47;whatever anybody is up for<&#47;em><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com.au&#47;maps&#47;ms?msid=217958050382155956677.0004bb515275928a3b1bc&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=-42.031293,147.492979&amp;spn=0.005124,0.011394">Google Maps link<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>The rough agenda we have for the meeting part is:<br &#47;><br &#47;>* TasLUG Organisational Structure Vote (and nominate some people to move us forward in whatever direction we end up going)<br &#47;>* SFD Planning<br &#47;>* Next Year&#39;s Meetup<br &#47;><br &#47;>The three organisational structure options for TasLUG currently being presented are:<br &#47;><br &#47;>* Remain a casual, non-incorporated community group (<em>TasLUG would not officially exist as an organisation, so events and ownership would need to be on the shoulders of individuals rather than TasLUG itself<&#47;em>)<br &#47;>* Reincorporate as TasLUG (<em>We would need to find ways to handle the ongoing administraive and financial overheads<&#47;em>)<br &#47;>* Become a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.linux.org.au&#47;policies&#47;sub-committee">subcommittee<&#47;a> of Linux Australia (<em>With this option, the LUG would become an arm of Linux Australia and gain access to some of their services and insurance coverage<&#47;em>).<br &#47;><br &#47;>Each of these options have their own pros and cons to consider, and there&#39;s already been some discussion on the mailing list. If anybody is interested in talking about or asking questions about the options, feel free to post on the forums or the mailing list :)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Hope to see you there!</p>
