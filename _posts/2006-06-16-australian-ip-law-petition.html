<p>Hi All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>As I&#39;m sure most of you know Australia is looking at amending its copyright laws to "harmonise" them with those of the US as part of the USAFTA. The current proposals go further than is necessary and go a long way to protecting the interests of big media and proprietary software in a similar way to the US DMCA. This is all despite a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.aph.gov.au&#47;House&#47;committee&#47;laca&#47;protection&#47;report.htm">parliamentary committee<&#47;a> and the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.austlii.edu.au&#47;cgi-bin&#47;disp.pl&#47;au&#47;cases&#47;cth&#47;high%5fct&#47;2005&#47;58.html?query=%7e+sony+stevens">High Court of Australia<&#47;a>( Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment [2005] HCA 58 - especially read Kirby, J) recommending otherwise.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Linux Australia has organised a petition against the changes  which can be found: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.linux.org.au&#47;law&#47;">here<&#47;a>. Rusty Russell has also organised a Q&amp;A session tonight (16th June) at 8:30 details are on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.linux.org.au&#47;">Linux Australia website<&#47;a>. <strong>UPDATE:<&#47;strong> a copy of the q&amp;a session and slides are now up on the Linux Australia website.<br &#47;><br &#47;>If you can&#39;t make it to the q&amp;a session tonight, then I&#39;d be happy to give a presentation on some on these issues at the next TasLUG meeting on the 29th.<br &#47;><br &#47;>This is a very important issue and I urge everyone to get involved in this lobbying effort - we really don&#39;t need the DMCA in Australia.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Ben.</p>
