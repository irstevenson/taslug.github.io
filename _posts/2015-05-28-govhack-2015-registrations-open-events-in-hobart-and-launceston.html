<p>Hi LUGgers,</p>
<p>Just to let you know that GovHack 2015 is open for registration. It's a great opportunity to go on a deep dive in developing an app or website to analyse open government datasets over a weekend. There are events in Hobart and Launceston, held on 3-5 July.</p>
<p>You can register here: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.govhack.org&#47;register-2015&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.govhack.org&#47;register-2015&#47;<&#47;a></p>
<p>Either get yourself a team together or register and turn up by yourself!</p>
