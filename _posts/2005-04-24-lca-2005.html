<p>Hi all,<br &#47;><br &#47;>As some of you are aware I&#39;ve been off in Canberra for the last week enjoying LCA2005 as part of the regional delegates program, sponsored by Sun. Today was the last day of the conf and so here&#39;s a brief report on the last week.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>LCA started with the miniconfs, I moved between the security and OpenOffice.org confs catching a heap of very interesting presentations. Some of the highlights of these miniconfs were a presentation on live computer forensics by Craig Pearce at the security conf and tutorials on macros by Ian Laurenson at OpenOffice.org conf.<br &#47;><br &#47;>On Wednesday the main conf opened and I went off to a seminar on recovering from HDD disasters by Theodore Tso, I learnt a ton about filesystems that I didn&#39;t know before and  I *hope* that I&#39;m never in a position to  have to use the techniques covered in the seminar.<br &#47;><br &#47;>In the afternoon I went off to indulge my other interests and watched the last bit of a Criminal appeal at the High Court - I found it fascinating but I&#39;m studying Law so I s&#39;pose I should.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Sun took all of the Regional Delegates out to dinner on the Wednesday where we got to mingle with the sun dudes and the conf organisers (and eat lots a great food and drink some very nice Shiraz).<br &#47;><br &#47;>Thurday&#39;s keynote by Andrew Tridgell was excellent covering quite a range of code testing stuff, SAMBA (of course) and the bitkeeper controversy :-). I then went off to see talks on Linux advocacy, CIFS, Software patents, TCP connection passing and OzTivo hacking - all of which were excelllent. The day was finished off by the HP-sponsored proffessional delegates networking (read: beer drinking) session.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Friday&#39;s keynote by Andrew Morton was an excellent insight into the way that the kernel is written and managed. I then went to presentations on X-windows which provided some very excellent eye candy :-).<br &#47;><br &#47;>The highlight of the conf dinner that night was a truly fine rendition of "we will rock you" by Rusty Russell :-)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Today was opened by an incredibly good keynote (or as he described it - "footnote") by Eben Moglen - inspired me to keep doing law and to do more on the advocacy side for free software. I then wafted around to presentations on CPUs (I saw a IBM POWER5 do the fastest kenel compile I&#39;ve ever seen - done in seconds!) and more desktop linux stuff.<br &#47;><br &#47;>That&#39;s the really short version of all the stuff I saw and did. LCA 2005 has ben an amazing experience. Met heaps of really interesting people, talked tech for five days, filled my brain with  tons of knowledge, got inspired to do more for free software and drank far too much beer :-)<br &#47;><br &#47;>The next LCA is in Dunedin in NZ in January - if its anything like LCA 2005 then it will be definiately worth going to :-)<br &#47;><br &#47;></p>
