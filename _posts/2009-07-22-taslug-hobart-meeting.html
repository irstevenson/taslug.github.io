<p>TasLUG Hobart Meeting.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Hello All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>It&#39;s been quite a few months since TasLUG has met in Hobart but after<br &#47;>linux.conf.au 2009 in Tasmania it&#39;s about time to stir up that local<br &#47;>community again! So come along, meet your local Linux community and<br &#47;>discuss all that open source goodness.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Date: 04&#47;08&#47;09<br &#47;><br &#47;>Time: 6:30 dinner, 7:30 start.<br &#47;>Please join us for an informal dinner at 6:30 beforehand in the restaurant area,<br &#47;>but feel free to come by at 7:30 as well.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Location: Hotel Soho<br &#47;>124 Davey Street, South Hobart 7000<br &#47;>(Corner of Davey and Molle St.)<br &#47;><br &#47;>To get us warmed up again, Leah Duncan will be doing a talk on what Linux Australia<br &#47;>is all about. She will also give us  an overview of the background<br &#47;>and history of TasLUG and the Linux community in general. Leah is Linux<br &#47;>Australia&#39;s current secretary and also one of the chief organisers of the recent linux.conf.au.<br &#47;><br &#47;>After the formal talk we hope to open the floor to the community to discuss the<br &#47;>future of TasLUG. Things such as the format of meetings, content for the<br &#47;>presentations and perhaps even the date+venue.<br &#47;><br &#47;>For those who are keen, we will likely stay on after the formal part of the meeting for<br &#47;>drinks, informal discussions and socialising. So make sure you hang around and<br &#47;>chil out with your fellow TasLUGers!<br &#47;><br &#47;>If you are unable to make this meeting please send us an email or leave a comment as we&#39;d<br &#47;>love to hear from you. Currently we are aiming for bi-monthly meetings on the first Tuesday<br &#47;>of each month. However, if there are enough people preferring a different date then that<br &#47;>could be considered.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Hope to see you all there!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;>Joshua Hesketh<br &#47;><br &#47;>taslug@gmail.com<br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org">taslug.scriptforge.org<&#47;a><br &#47;>Map: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com.au&#47;maps?oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&q=SoHo+hotel&near=Hobart+TAS&fb=1&split=1&gl=au&cid=0,0,14398458215915841071&ei=vrhlSqmUMtSJkQWZ8rXNDg&ll=-42.888716,147.325995&spn=0.007625,0.01929&z=16">http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com.au&#47;maps?oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&q=SoHo+hotel&near=Hobart+TAS&fb=1&split=1&gl=au&cid=0,0,14398458215915841071&ei=vrhlSqmUMtSJkQWZ8rXNDg&ll=-42.888716,147.325995&spn=0.007625,0.01929&z=16<&#47;a><br &#47;></p>
