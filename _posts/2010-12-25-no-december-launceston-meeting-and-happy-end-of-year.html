<p>For obvious reasons we&#39;re not holding a meeting for December (the main one being that our usual venue is closed on the 25th).<br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;ll be back together in 2011 on the 29th of January with a to-be-confirmed presentation. If Debian 6.0 is released by that date, Henry (forum user Attitude) is keen to do a Debian install. Alternatively, I might be keen to talk about my recent experiences with open source voice recognition software. If anybody&#39;s keen to to a Free&#47;Open Source talk&#47;presentation&#47;tutorial&#47;interpretive dance for January or any other time next year, feel free to post in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;modules&#47;newbb&#47;viewtopic.php?topic_id=193&amp;forum=6">this forum thread<&#47;a>, comment on this news post, or shoot me a private message :)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Hope everyone has a fantastic end to 2010!</p>
