<p><strong>Software Freedom Day<&#47;strong></p>
<p>The 19th of September is Software Freedom Day! We'll be hosting an event in Launceston (<em>if anybody else is running one, please let us know<&#47;em>)!</p>
<p>This year, we'll be gathering at the <strong><a href="http:&#47;&#47;goo.gl&#47;maps&#47;jWkOa">Launceston Bowls Club<&#47;a><&#47;strong> on Home Point Parade near the Seaport between <strong>10am and 3pm<&#47;strong>.</p>
<p>Come along to learn about Free&#47;Open Source Software and learn what people within the community are doing with it!</p>
