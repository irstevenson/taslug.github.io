<p>Just a quick note that I have decided to cancel the meeting of TasLUG in Hobart for November as I will be interstate and there was no other talk scheduled for this month. I would like to apologize for the sporadic updates lately, as I finish my uni degree my workload got slightly crazy.</p>
<p>I would like to organise an end of year dinner for sometime in December for the TasLUGgers in Hobart. Details will follow, but it will probably be a bit earlier in December to avoid the holiday silliness. The only agenda for said dinner is to enjoy the company of fellow TasLUGgers and to discuss, plan and schedule meeting ideas for meetings in 2015.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Scott Bragg</p>
