Hi people! For this month's Launceston meeting, we will look at creating,
manipulating and converting raster based images with ImageMagick. While used
as a terminal tool, ImageMagick is a set of libraries that can be interfaced
from a number of programming languages to allow the user to create their own
image manipulation applications. This presentation will discuss many of
ImageMagick's options and demonstrate a range of its features.


 **Where**
Enterprize
22-24 Patterson St

**When**
Saturday 27th January
2:00pm Start

As always, everybody is welcome to come along and join the discussion. Hope to
see you there!
