Hi LUGers!  
  
This month we will be meeting at Kickstart Arts in Newtown again. Check the
signage out front as to which room we are in.  
  
This month we have our venerable TasLUG member Peter Lawler speaking LEDE
which is an active fork of OpenWRT. With many of us thinking of an upgrade to
our home routers to take advantage of higher speed WiFi and broadband, there's
no better time to put some open source on your gateway to the Interwebs. There
is also be some time for a lightning talk or two if you have something you
want to discuss or demo.  
  
We'll get in some Pizza from Pizzarazzi and there will be tea and coffee
available but you can also bring along a refreshment.  
  
_When_: Open at 6pm for 6:30pm start/pizza order Thursday 18th May 2017
