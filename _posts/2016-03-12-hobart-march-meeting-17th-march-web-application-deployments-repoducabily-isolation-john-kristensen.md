Hello... is this thing on? Testing.. one chew one chew... We're at the end of
the first quarter of 2016 and I can finally catch my breath and catch up on
fixing the list server. Sorry for the late notice about this month's meeting.
This month we have our own John Kristensen (@jerrykan) talking about tools to
help you deploy web applications and there's going to be a hint of Docker
involved. Can't wait! Also we have our now regular 'tech support' segment, so
bring your issues to the hive mind.

### Where

Hotel SOHO - 124 Davey St, Hobart

### When

Thursday 17th March from 6pm.

### Agenda

  * 6pm - Arrive, set up, chat, grab a drink and some food
  * 6.30pm - The usual news, command line stuff and tech support.
  * 7.15pm - The Talk: _Web Application Deployments:_ Repoducabily & Isolation - John Kristensen
    * All web application need run in at least two environments (Development & Production), but quite often they run in many more (Test, QA, Staging, etc.). We talk will cover the sorts of problems that can arise when taking an application from a development environment with a practical example of how using containers (ie. Docker) to avoid some of these pitfalls.

### Coming up

  * April - busy organising something with a bent on FOSS and radios.
  * May - nothing planned yet - got a talk - let me know!
