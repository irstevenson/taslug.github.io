<p>The Hobart April meeting (Thursday 28th) will be a social affair at the Republic Bar in North Hobart at 7:30pm. The food there is pretty good with dishes ranging from about $15-20. <br &#47;>Email me before Wednesday 5pm if you&#39;re keen on eating a meal there so I can <br &#47;>book, otherwise just come along for some beers and a chat about linuxy stuff.</p>
