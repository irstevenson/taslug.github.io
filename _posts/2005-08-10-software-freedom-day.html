<p>A meeting to discuss SFD events, etc. will be held on Thursday 18th August 7:30PM on irc.taslug.scriptforge.org #taslug. I have received confirmation that the materials have been sent and should arrive any day. We have one month to get organised, so its all systems go to run a successful SFD - any help will be greatly appreciated :).<br &#47;></p>
