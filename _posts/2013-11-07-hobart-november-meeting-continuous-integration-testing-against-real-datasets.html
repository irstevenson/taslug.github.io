<ul>
<li><b>18:00 -<&#47;b> early mingle, chin wagging, etc<&#47;li>
<li><b>18:30 -<&#47;b> Question and<br &#47;>answer session, lightening talks, news of note, new website discussion.<&#47;li>
<li><b>19:00 - <&#47;b><b>Josh Hesketh - Continuous integration testing against real datasets for Openstack<&#47;b><br &#47;><br &#47;>    OpenStack is one of the largest and most active projects around with over 92,245 commits made by 1,708 contributors representing 1,736,343 lines of code. It is deployed in countless data centers by hundreds of companies some of which run trunk version. One of the things OpenStack does very well is it ensures trunk always works. In this talk Joshua Hesketh will go over what it takes to submit a patch into the OpenStack environment and what effect that triggers. That is, how are tests launched, how do we ensure the high quality of code, how do we make sure OpenStack always runs and how do we manage the commits over 20 components that make up OpenStack. Specifically we will look at Turbo-Hipster, a new tool Josh has been working on to ensure Nova (the compute engine) performs database schema changes correctly against real production datasets and what effect this will have for upstream developers.<br &#47;>
