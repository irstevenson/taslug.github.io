<p>Hi LUGgers,</p>
<p>It's certainly getting colder but that makes a great excuse to head to SoHo for our monthly meeting. This month we're heading back to the cloud with Tim Serong talking about the Ceph cloud object, block and file store. Since I've been having some non cloud filesystem issues this month, I will certainly be taking notes!</p>
<p><strong>When<&#47;strong>: Thursday 21st May 2015 from 6pm.</p>
<p><strong>Where<&#47;strong>: Hotel SOHO, 124 Davey St, Hobart<br />
(it seems we've been ursurped from our downstairs room by a LEGO group that meets weekly, so it's probable that we will be upstairs again. Watch out for a sign or ask the friendly bar staff as you order a drink!).</p>
<h2><strong>Agenda<&#47;strong><&#47;h2><br />
6pm-6.30pm - Arrive, mingle, chat, setup, grab beers and food.<br />
