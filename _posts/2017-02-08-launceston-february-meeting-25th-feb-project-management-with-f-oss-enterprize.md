Hi people! For this month's Launceston meeting, we'll be taking a look at
using ProjectLibre, Task Coach and Freeplane in project management contexts.
Please note the **change in venue**. After 9 years, TasLUG's Launceston
meetings will be relocating from the Royal Oak to Enterprize on Patterson
Street, which will give us access to a larger, more accommodating space. To
celebrate, we'll be opening the meeting with a 20 minute recap of TasLUG
history - a great introduction for newcomers and a chance to reminisce for
long-time attendees.

**Where**
Enterprize
22-24 Patterson St

**When**
Saturday 25th February
2:00pm Start

As always, everybody is welcome to come along and join the discussion. Hope to
see you there!
