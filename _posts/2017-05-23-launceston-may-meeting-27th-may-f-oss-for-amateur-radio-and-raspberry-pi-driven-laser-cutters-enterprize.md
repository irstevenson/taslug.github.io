Hi people! For this month's Launceston meeting, we have Scott Bragg from
Hobart talking about how he merges Linux and open source with amateur radio.
Over the past months a group in Hobart have been tinkering with a new digital
transmission mode called FSQ and Scott has been building an automated beacon
using an Arduino, a clock generator, a RTLSDR dongle and a Raspberry Pi.  
Additionally, Craig Marshall from Hobart Makers will give a short update of
efforts to improve their recently acquired laser cutter by replacing the
control system with a Raspberry Pi, and asking for advice on the next steps to
get a good open source CAD/CAM workflow.
