Hello LUGgers!

This month we have Andrew Elwell giving us a talk about High Performance
Computing. Beat the winter by joining us at Hotel SoHO this Thursday while we
turn up the megahertz and lower the latency.

Andrew will be talking about High Performance Computing (HPC) and covering
topics such as clustering, systems management, some basic overview of
performance, what makes HPC so "special" (and expensive) and how HPC differs
from High Throughput Computing, Cloud and other fashionable technologies.
