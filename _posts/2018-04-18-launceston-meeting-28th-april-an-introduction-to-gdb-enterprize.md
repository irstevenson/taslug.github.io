Hi people! This month we are going to be looking at the major feature of

during a debug session. If you are a beginner or an old hand there will be
something for everyone in this talk.

**When**
Saturday 28th April
2:00pm Start

As always, everybody is welcome to come along and join the discussion. Hope to
see you there!
