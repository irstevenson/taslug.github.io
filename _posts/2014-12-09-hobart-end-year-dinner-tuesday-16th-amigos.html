<p>I've booked a table at Amigos for Tuesday 16th December at 6.30pm.</p>
<p>I chose Tuesday rather than our normal Thursday as they have a $22 special for 3 courses as well as their standard menu.</p>
<p>If you would like to come to dinner, please let me know by RSVP to <a href="mailto:jsbragg@scriptforge.org">jsbragg@scriptforge.org<&#47;a> <strong>as soon as possible<&#47;strong>. It will be a great time to chat about 2014 and make plans for 2015.</p>
<pre>Where: Amigos, Elizabeth St, North Hobart - website <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amigostas.com.au&#47;" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;www.amigostas.com.au&#47;<&#47;a><br />
When: Tuesday 16th December 2014, 6.30pm<&#47;pre></p>
