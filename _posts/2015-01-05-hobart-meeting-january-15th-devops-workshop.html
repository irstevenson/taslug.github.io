  content: I recommend pre configuring systems for anyone thinking about taking part
    in future - its a pain to discover you don't have your ssh keys&#47;vm networks
    correctly set up on the night.

<p>taslug.add(new Year(2015));</p>
<p>I hope everyone had a great holiday over the xmas and new year break. Some of us are lucky and are headed over to Auckland for LCA 2015 this month, so for those that can't make it, this month I'm hoping to run a DevOps challenge! Instead of the normal chat and talk, we all set up our laptops, grab a drink and set up a VM with specific configuration tasks.</p>
<p>The idea is to pick a system configuration management tool - Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, ...(any others?)... and at 6.30pm after we've set up and ordered a drink I'll hand out the tasks to complete. I've made some simple, medium and hard tasks for you to get done in the 1 to 1.5 hours set aside for completing the tasks.</p>
<p>This will be great if you are new to config management tools you can pick one and learn the basics in a laid back challenge&#47;lab environment, and there will be some people in our group already familiar with to ask for help if you get stuck. Those experienced in one tool might want to pick another they don't know, and pick up some basics on the day!</p>
<p>After we finish the tasks, we'll bring up your solutions to the group on the big screen. This way we can take a look at how the same tasks are done with the different tools, and even the different approaches of doing the same thing with the same tool!</p>
<p>Bring your laptop with a virtual machine of a clean install of Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS or your favourite distro. I will have only a limited number of VMs that I could configure for people unable to run a virtual server themselves.</p>
<p>I've prepared the list of tasks but haven't completed them myself, so I'll be in the same boat as everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>When<&#47;strong>: Thursday 15th January 2015 from 6pm.</p>
<p><strong>Where<&#47;strong>: Hotel SOHO, 124 Davey St, Hobart<br />
(we'll probably be in the downstairs function room, keep an eye out for the signs).</p>
