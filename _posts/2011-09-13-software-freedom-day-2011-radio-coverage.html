<p>For anybody who&#39;s interested, Henry (forum user attitude) and I are going to be on ABC Statewide Evenings tonight (Monday the 12th) between 7:30pm and 8:00pm talking to Annie Warburton about Software Freedom Day.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Edit: Whoopsie. It turns out that ABC only like to do one interview per event&#47;happening, so we won&#39;t be appearing (or sounding like we&#39;re appearing) on North Tas Breakfast with Belinda King (but listen to her show anyway).<br &#47;><br &#47;>Finally, I&#39;ll be prerecording an interview with John Gregory from WAY FM, but I couldn&#39;t get firm details on if&#47;when that would be aired.<br &#47;><br &#47;>If you tune in, comment about it in the forums!</p>
