<p>For anybody who wasn&#39;t aware, Wolfire Games has been running a "Pay what you want" sale for a suite of five independant cross platform (Windows, MacOS and Linux) games. When making the purchase, contributors are able to choose how their money is split up between the game developers and two not for profit charities.<br &#47;><br &#47;>On the 10th of May, it was announced via <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;SteveSwink&#47;status&#47;13765594449">Twitter<&#47;a> that if the week long promotion reached USD$1,000,000, three of the games would release their source code.<br &#47;><br &#47;>That milestone has been reached, the offer has been extended for a few more days, and a fourth game within the suite is releasing source.<br &#47;><br &#47;>More information can be found here:<br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wolfire.com&#47;humble">http:&#47;&#47;www.wolfire.com&#47;humble<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>An interesting statistic: on average, Linux users on average donate larger figures than MacOS or Windows users and have contributed a quarter of the money raised.</p>
