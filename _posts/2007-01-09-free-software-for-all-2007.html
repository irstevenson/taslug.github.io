<p>G&#39;day everyone<br &#47;><br &#47;>As a follow up to our Software Freedom Day event in Launceston last year, we are planning to hold another event (which we&#39;re titling "Free Software For All") on Sunday the 25th of February.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>We will be covering 5 major areas:<br &#47;>* Home productivity - Showing off OpenOffice, Firefox, the usual stuff.<br &#47;>* Business productivity - We&#39;re hoping to demo an open source POS setup with a wedge bar code scanner. Business productivity will also cover &#39;specialist&#39; apps like Blender3D, Eclipse and Audacity.<br &#47;>* Multi-media - Audio&#47;Video playing, streaming, transcoding, etc.<br &#47;>* Distros&#47;WMs - Helping newbies understand the giant confusing mass of operating system and window manager variants.<br &#47;>* Games - Neverball, Nexuiz, Nethack, Armagetron, Scorched3D, etc. We&#39;ll be also having some friendly tournaments (with prizes if all goes well).<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>It&#39;s going to be a fantastic day. Anyone who wants to show up is of course, more than welcome.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>Anyone that&#39;s interested in assisting with the planning or has some resources they&#39;d like to donate, should shoot an email off to Waide at waide.soper@gmail.com<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;ll post an update once we&#39;ve confirmed the event time.</p>
