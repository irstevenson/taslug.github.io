<p>Hi All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>This month&#39;s meeting will be held at 7:30pm (Thursday 31st August), downstairs at Bridie O&#39;Reilly&#39;s. We&#39;ll be discussing the plans for SFD, so if you have any ideas or want to offer your help then come along! As usual, we&#39;ll also be answering any questions about linux and floss as well :).<br &#47;><br &#47;>Sorry for the late notice, uni has overtaken my life again :)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Ben.</p>
