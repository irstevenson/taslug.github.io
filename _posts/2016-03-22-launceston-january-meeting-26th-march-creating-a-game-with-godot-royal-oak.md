Hi people! Apologies for the late post.


For this month's Launceston meeting, we'll be going through the steps of
creating a small example game from scratch using the F/OSS [Godot Game
Engine](http://godotengine.org/ "http://godotengine.org/" ).


This presentation will be an experimental attempt to create a game within a
significantly short amount of time. The game may or may not be playable by the
end of the meeting, but regardless, a completed version of the game and its
sources will be made available at some point following the meeting.
