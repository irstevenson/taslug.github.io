<p>Firstly, many thanks to Pia for taking the time to visit us. As always her talk was informative and enjoyable. Thanks to Josh (not me, the other one) as well for thinking ahead and bringing along his XO (OLPC laptop).<br &#47;><br &#47;>Secondly, the Royal Oak is available to us for the last Saturday of every month at 2:00pm.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Also, there was a little confusion about which door we were meant to be entering by. The second Brisbane St door from the intersection is the one we&#39;re after (it has a flight of stairs at the far end of the hallway), and the room we&#39;re using is the second door on the right.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Our next meeting will be on the 28th of June (hopefully we won&#39;t be competing with the footy that weekend). I&#39;ll put up a notice with a rough agenda soon and pop some notes from yesterday&#39;s meeting on the forum.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Additional thanks to everybody who showed up!</p>
