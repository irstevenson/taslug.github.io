<p>Want to talk at an open source conference? OSDC 2015 is coming to Hobart and the CFP is now open. Check out the website at: <a href="https:&#47;&#47;2015.osdc.com.au&#47;cfp&#47;">https:&#47;&#47;2015.osdc.com.au&#47;cfp&#47;<&#47;a></p>
<p>The <em>Open Source Developers' Conference<&#47;em> is a not-for-profit conference covering all aspects of Open Source Technology, from software and systems to open data. For the past 11 years OSDC has been held across Australia and New Zealand, and in 2015 will be hosted for the first time in Tasmania, from October 27-29 at the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;2015.osdc.com.au&#47;venue">Wrest Point Convention Centre<&#47;a> in Hobart.</p>
<p>The focus for OSDC 2015 is Opening Up For A Better World. Open source software, hardware and standards facilitate higher quality technology, better security and faster innovation; open data allows us to better discover and understand the world we live in; open government aims to ensure that citizens can participate in their democracy; open access publishing exists to spread knowledge and allow that knowledge to be built upon. Open by design is the best default.</p>
