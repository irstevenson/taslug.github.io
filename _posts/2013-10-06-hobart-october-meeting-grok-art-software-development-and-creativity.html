<li><b>19:00 - <&#47;b><b>Matthew Oakes - Grok.art: Software Development and Creativity<&#47;b><br &#47;>    Looking at the software development profession, there is a recognition that it is a young field which needs evolution to achieve the reliable success strategies enjoyed by other professions. Is it more like science, engineering or art? My study has been a combination of Fine Art and Information Systems and I see a pressing need to encourage the exploration and understanding of creativity in relation to systems. It is an intrinsic part of what we do whether you are a hobbyist, developer, sysadmin, tester, manager or client. However its a topic which generally brings looks of horror and quick subject changes, especially from managers of large projects. Ignoring creativity limits avoids opportunities limiting effectiveness of systems and change. In this talk I explore creativity, art, ideas and models in the hope that we can all become better at what we do.<br &#47;>
