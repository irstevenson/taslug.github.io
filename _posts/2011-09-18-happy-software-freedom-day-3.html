<p>It&#39;s a little late in the day, but I just wanted to take a moment to say happy Software Freedom Day and a big thankyou to everybody who came along (We&#39;re guestimating somewhere around 100 people through the doors).<br &#47;><br &#47;>In particular Henry (forum user Attitude) and Frank (forum user Packrat) put great effort into planning and organising, and it was great to see so much fantastic content from everybody who showed up (I think we had double the number of &#39;stalls&#39; compared to last year).<br &#47;><br &#47;>I had some camera troubles on the day, but I managed to salvage <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;cheeseness&#47;sets&#47;72157627564402237&#47;detail&#47;">a few shots<&#47;a>. If anybody has anything they want to share, I&#39;ll be happy to link to them.<br &#47;><br &#47;>[img]<a href="http:&#47;&#47;farm7.static.flickr.com&#47;6207&#47;6155369146_9403b7b295_m.jpg">http:&#47;&#47;farm7.static.flickr.com&#47;6207&#47;6155369146_9403b7b295_m.jpg<&#47;a>[&#47;img]</p>
