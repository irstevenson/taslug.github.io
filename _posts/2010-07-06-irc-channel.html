<p>I&#39;ve noticed that there seems to be an extremely lite presence on IRC! Is this simply due to not much call for the IRC channel or simply that this median is not used in preference to email or another form of communication?<br &#47;><br &#47;>Either way I&#39;ve propped myself into the #taslug IRC channel and will await some others to maybe join in&#8230;<br &#47;><br &#47;>Scott (aka VK7HSE)</p>
