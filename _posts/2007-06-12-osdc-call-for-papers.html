<p>Open Source Developers&#39; Conference 2007 - Brisbane Australia<br &#47;>"Success in Development &amp; Business"<br &#47;><br &#47;>OSDC is an Australian grass-roots conference providing Open Source developers with an opportunity to meet, share, learn, and of course show-off. OSDC focuses on Open Source developers building solutions directly for customers and other end users, anything goes as long as the code or the development platform is Open Source. Last year&#39;s conference attracted over 180 people, 60 talks, and 6 tutorials. Entry for delegates is kept easy by maintaining a low registration fee (approx $300), which always includes the conference dinner.<br &#47;><br &#47;>This year OSDC will be held in Brisbane (Australia) from the 26th to the 29th of November, with an extra dedicated stream for presentations on Open Source business development, case studies, software process, and project management. The theme for this year&#39;s conference is "Success in Development &amp; Business". If you are an Open Source maintainer, developer or user we would encourage you to submit a talk proposal on the open-source tools, solutions, technologies, or languages you are working with.<br &#47;><br &#47;>OSDC 2007 Brisbane (Australia) - Key Program Dates:<br &#47;><br &#47;>30 Jun - Initial proposals (short abstract) due<br &#47;>31 Jul - Proposal acceptance<br &#47;>31 Aug - Submission deadline<br &#47;>15 Sep - Peer-review response (optional)<br &#47;>30 Sep - Final version for proceedings<br &#47;><br &#47;>26 Nov - OSDC 2007 Tutorials<br &#47;>27-29 Nov - OSDC 2007 Main Conference!<br &#47;><br &#47;>For all information, contacts and updates, see the OSDC conference web site at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;osdc.com.au&#47;Previous">http:&#47;&#47;osdc.com.au&#47;Previous<&#47;a> years have included numerous talks on topics such as:<br &#47;><br &#47;>- FOSS Software Development Tools, Software Process and Project Management<br &#47;>- Languages&#47;Platforms: C&#47;C++, Java, C#&#47;Mono&#47;OSS.Net<br &#47;>- Scripting: Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby<br &#47;>- Databases<br &#47;>- Education<br &#47;>- Web Technologies<br &#47;>- Emerging Technologies and Innovation<br &#47;><br &#47;>For more details and to submit your proposal(s), see <a href="http:&#47;&#47;osdc.com.au&#47;papers&#47;cfp.html">http:&#47;&#47;osdc.com.au&#47;papers&#47;cfp.html<&#47;a><br &#47;>If you have any questions or require assistance with your submission, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask!<br &#47;><br &#47;>We recognise the increasing importance of Open Source in providing a medium for collaboration between individuals, researchers, business and government.
