<p>Hi LUGgers!</p>
<p>I hope everyone has recovered from OSDC2015 last month. Since we've probably had our fill of presentations and talks, and December always gets crazy with other end of year festivities, I'm making the November meeting the last meeting for Hobart in 2015. And since our usual venue is completely booked out with a function we've got a table upstairs at TQ instead.</p>
<p><strong>When:<&#47;strong> Thursday 17th September 2015 from <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_768660950"><span class="aQJ">6pm<&#47;span><&#47;span>.</p>
<p><strong>Where:<&#47;strong> Tasmanian Quartermasters, 132 Elizabeth St, Hobart</p>
<p><strong>Agenda: <&#47;strong>6pm - Arrive, drink, eat and get to work!</p>
<p>For those wanting to help out on the TasLUG infrastructure, I've got some devops work I need some help with which can be broken up into some smaller tasks. I'd like to create&nbsp; Ansible playbooks to deploy a new mail server, antispam facilities, Mailman v3, and move the current mailing list over. And if there's time do the same for TasLUG DNS and website as well. It would be great if we could use the meeting to knock some of this work over.</p>
<p>Other than that you can bring your own project to explain and hack on for a few hours (a bit of show and tell). Perhaps a stint of pair programming with fresh eyes will help find that nasty bug you've been looking for recently.</p>
<p>Could you please send me a message on IRC or email <a href="mailto:jsbragg@scriptforge.org">jsbragg@scriptforge.org<&#47;a> if you intend on coming so I can make sure we have a table big enough.</p>
