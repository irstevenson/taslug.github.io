<p>Hiya TasLUGgers</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Software Freedom Day last month, Scott is putting forward a talk and demo on ProjectLibre, which is an open source replacement for the other project management tool by that less open source company that makes that stuff that runs on computers. He has been using it to keep track of my uni workload and planning some home projects.</p>
<p>Since being swamped with the end of my uni degree projects, I'm not quite sure how long this demo will be, so there will also be a discussion on Accessibility Tools&#47;Features in the current batch of window managers on Linux - something that came up during SFD that we were not quite prepared for!</p>
<p><strong>When<&#47;strong>: Thursday 16th October 2014 from 6pm.<br />
<strong>Where<&#47;strong>: Hotel SOHO, 124 Davey St, Hobart<br />
(we'll probably be in the downstairs function room, keep an eye out for the signs).</p>
<h2><strong>Agenda<&#47;strong><&#47;h2><br />
6pm - Arrive, mingle, setup, chat<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">6.30pm - News, announcements and discussion (updates, shellshock, accessibility...)<br />
<&#47;span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">7pm - ProjectLibre<br />
<&#47;span>7.45pm - Dinner and drinks</p>
<h2><em><strong>Coming up soon:<&#47;strong><&#47;em><&#47;h2><br />
We are in need of some speakers for November, December and January! Please contact me if you would like to demo something open source, hardware or software, that you are passionate about.</p>
<p><strong>IN PARTICULAR: <&#47;strong>Scott will not be available during the normal time for TasLUG in November, so if one of our regulars could step up and organise our November meeting that would be amazeballs.</p>
