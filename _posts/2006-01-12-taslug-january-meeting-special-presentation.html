<p>Hi all,<br &#47;><br &#47;>This month TasLUG have a guest presenter from Germany who will be presenting on Grid Computing and the ROOT toolkit (details follow). We&#39;ve done this meeting in conjunction with SAGE-AU who have provided us with a venue at IMB in Murray St (bit more central than the Glenorchy Library). So everyone note the change in our usual meeting date to the 20th Jan which is a Friday, time - 6:00pm, and venue (IMB in Murray St.)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Hopefully I&#39;ll catch you all there for what looks to be a fascinating presentation.<br &#47;><br &#47;>BTW look out for the write-up on TasLUG in this month&#39;s Linux Format mag! :)<br &#47;><br &#47;>PS. These are the details that SAGE-AU posted to their list, you can RSVP to me if you&#39;d prefer and I&#39;ll hand on the info about numbers.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Details Follow:<br &#47;><br &#47;>DATE:  Friday, January 20th, 2006<br &#47;><br &#47;>  TIME:  6:00 PM<br &#47;><br &#47;>  VENUE:<br &#47;>      Information Management Branch     <br &#47;>        Department of Education<br &#47;>        Level 1, 73 Murray Street<br &#47;>        Catch lift to first floor.<br &#47;><br &#47;>        In the event that it is not possible for us to leave the door<br &#47;>        open due to security reasons, we will have the door manned until<br &#47;>        6:15pm. After this time, there will be a sign put on the door<br &#47;>        with a mobile number to ring to gain entry.  With this in mind,<br &#47;>        it would be appreciated if all those attending could be there<br &#47;>        no later than 6:15pm. <br &#47;><br &#47;>  AGENDA:<br &#47;>  6:15<br &#47;>        Welcome and general business.<br &#47;><br &#47;>  6:30<br &#47;>        A presentation by Dr Ruediger Berlich<br &#47;>        (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;ruediger.berlich.com&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;ruediger.berlich.com&#47;<&#47;a>)<br &#47;>        from Germany who is in Hobart for AusGrid 2006:<br &#47;><br &#47;>        Grid Computing:<br &#47;>        This is about building a huge, worldwide compute infrastructure,<br &#47;><br &#47;>        mainly for the upcoming experiments<br &#47;>        of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN &#47; Geneva. These<br &#47;>        will produce about 10 petabyte of data per year, which<br &#47;>        are being accessed by 6000 physicists worldwide.<br &#47;>        The current Grid infrastructure, in the context of <br &#47;>        the European Union initiative EGEE, comprises about<br &#47;>        14,000 CPUs, all running under Linux.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>        The ROOT toolkit:<br &#47;>        This is a graphical analysis toolkit comprising several<br &#47;>        million lines of code. As it is based around a C++ <br &#47;>        _interpreter_, it can be used for virtually any purpose.<br &#47;>        Just link your own libraries with the interpreter and<br &#47;>        access the functions from you C++ scripts. ROOT is <br &#47;>        one of the largest open source projects (surely after<br &#47;>        Apache and the Linux kernel, but still &#8230;), but still<br &#47;>        mostly unknown outside the physics community. I perceive<br &#47;>        the benefit of ROOT to the OSS community to be potentially<br &#47;>        large, so I would like to do some dissemination work<br &#47;>        for this project.       <br &#47;><br &#47;>  7:30<br &#47;>      Food and General discussion (Drinks and snacks provided)</p>
