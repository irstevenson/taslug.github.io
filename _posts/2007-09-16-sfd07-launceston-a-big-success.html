<p>Wow, what a day. After a slow start and a few monitor failures (thankfully we had spares), final estimates put us at somewhere between 80 and 100 people.<br &#47;><br &#47;>We were interviewed by a nice young lass from ABC radio named Siobhan, who is planning on airing a story on the event at some stage within the next few days.<br &#47;><br &#47;>We had 26 survey forms filled out and a huge amount of direct positive feedback during the event.<br &#47;><br &#47;>A big thanks to Leah and Joel for their mention on the radio this morning, and an extra huge thank-you to everyone who showed up. There was a real sense of community, and the genuine interest - both from those eager to learn something new and from those who came for the company of fellow FOSS enthusiasts certainly made the last two hectic weeks worthwhile.<br &#47;><br &#47;>More after we&#39;ve had some sleep.<br &#47;><br &#47;>edit: Fixed a typo.<br &#47;><br &#47;>edit by Leah - Chris was actually on holiday this week, but thanks to him anyway for allowing us such a great forum to help people and spread the word. :-)</p>
