<p>Hi all,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Here&#39;s the plan: <br &#47;>an expo&#47;installfest at Glenorchy Library (I have already booked the room).<br &#47;>A screening of Revolution OS either on the night or the night before (<strong>EDIT:<&#47;strong> I&#39;ve been given permission for us to show it from the copyright holders)<br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;ve been sent 100 OpenCD&#39;s for distribution :).<br &#47;>Neal is working on a flyer promoting F&#47;LOSS and TasLUG to distribute with the CDs.<br &#47;>I&#39;ve been sent a PR from LA so I&#39;ll contact my friend at the ABC and see if we can get some airplay (<strong>EDIT<&#47;strong> I have contacted the ABC and sent out PRs as well, I&#39;ve got some positive responses) :)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Read on for how you can help us out:<br &#47;>So what needs to be done:<br &#47;>Decisions on what we are going to show off at the expo&#47;installfest and the acquisition of computers to show it on.<br &#47;>A venue and&#47;or a projector for the screening of Revolution OS (Neal is already on the case and I&#39;ll make some enquiries at the uni too).<br &#47;>If anyone wants to give tutorials&#47;seminars now is the time to tell me so I can get a bit of a program together by next week - seminars on stuff like OpenOffice.org, GIMP v Photoshop, and that sort of thing. I&#39;ll give one on Linux in small business. <br &#47;>A banner for in the room and an A3 poster for the noticeboard in the library.<br &#47;>Locating a penguin suit which Lucy has generously offered to don for the expo&#47;installfest (if we can find a costume :) ).<br &#47;><br &#47;>any other ideas :)<br &#47;></p>
