<p><strong>Update: <&#47;strong>I fired my proof-reader. Actually I need to prepare this copy earlier in the month and not rush it to print. LCA is in Hobart in 2017 and Julius is talking about ProxMox in March.</p>
<p>This month we will have some highlights from the recent LCA talks as well as other recent conferences such as OSDC, HOPEX and CCC. Hey, did you hear that Hobart is hosting Linux.Conf.Au in 2017? Let's also have a few words about that.</p>
<p>Tim Serong has put his hand up to put OSDC in Hobart in October, so there will be some discussion on that front as well.</p>
<p><strong>When<&#47;strong>: Thursday 19th February 2015 from 6pm.</p>
<p><strong>Where<&#47;strong>: Hotel SOHO, 124 Davey St, Hobart<br />
(we'll probably be in the downstairs function room, keep an eye out for the signs).</p>
<h2><strong>Agenda<&#47;strong><&#47;h2><br />
6pm - Arrive, mingle, setup, chat<br />
6.30pm - Discussion about OSDC and LCA in Hobart<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">7.00pm - Playback and Discussion of highlight videos<br />
8.00<&#47;span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">pm - Dinner and close<&#47;span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em><strong>Coming up soon:<&#47;strong><&#47;em><&#47;h2><br />
<em>March: Julius Roberts is talking about ProxMox, a web interface for managing KVM machines and containers.<&#47;em></p>
<p>We will be returning to our DevOps challenge in the coming few months. This is turning into an ongoing tutorial and comparison about different config management systems. You should be able to join in at any time.</p>
<p>We are in need of some speakers for 2015! Please contact me if you would like to demo something open source, hardware or software, that you are passionate about. Bonus points if it's about upcoming and right now technologies such as SystemD or Wayland!</p>
