<p>I haven&#39;t really posted Humble Bundle news here before, but since the current bundle has more first-time-on-Linux games than ever before, I thought it&#39;d be worth a mention.<br &#47;><br &#47;>For anybody who doesn&#39;t know, the Humble Bundle promotions package together independently developed games for Linux, MacOS and Windows, all DRM-free, and sell them under a pay-what-you-want model, with a customisable portion of payments going to charities.<br &#47;><br &#47;>To date, these bundles have helped promote 37 native Linux games (<em>many of which have been developed for the bundle they were featured in<&#47;em>), and have challenged a lot of assumptions about whether or not Linux users are willing to pay for commercial software. With Linux users traditionally paying more on average than any other platform, and contributing a roughly equal share of combined revenue compared to MacOS users.<br &#47;><br &#47;>In addition to encouraging the development of native Linux games, most of the bundles have also been accompanied by the open sourcing of an existing game or engine.<br &#47;><br &#47;>If you care about platform equality or the promotion of Linux, take a look at what these guys are doing. You can pay whatever you want (<em>as little as one cent<&#47;em>), but think about where your money goes and what it means.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The games featured in the current bundle (<em>which has just passed US$1.3M and will be available for the next 11 days<&#47;em>) are <strong>NightSky<&#47;strong> (<em>a 2D physics puzzle platformer<&#47;em>), <strong>Shank<&#47;strong> (<em>a 2D beat-em-up<&#47;em>), <strong>Super Meat Boy<&#47;strong> (<em>a tricky 3D side scrolling platformer<&#47;em>), <strong>Bit.Trip Runner<&#47;strong> (<em>a "retro-styled music-platformer"<&#47;em>) and <strong>Jamestown<&#47;strong> (<em>a top scrolling arcade shooter<&#47;em>). If you pay more than the average purchase price, you also get <strong>Cave Story+<&#47;strong> (<em>a revamped version of a popular free platformer<&#47;em>), and <strong>Gratuitous Space Battles<&#47;strong> (<em>a turn based-ish sci-fi strategy<&#47;em>).<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.humblebundle.com">Humble Bundle Website<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>Update: I&#39;ve just been given the goahead to publish some statistics that expand upon and compare the stats currently available via the Humble Bundle website.
