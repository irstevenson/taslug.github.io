<p>G&#39;day everyone<br &#47;><br &#47;>After having some time to get used to Fedora 15, I thought it might be interesting to have a bit of a round table discussion about Gnome 3 this month. We&#39;ll be looking at three main areas: what&#39;s new in Gnome 3, some of the philosophies and intentions behind the new interface design, and some workarounds for people who might be finding it too much of a transition.<br &#47;><br &#47;><strong>2:00pm<br &#47;>Saturday 25th June (the last Saturday of the month)<br &#47;>Royal Oak<br &#47;>Launceston<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br &#47;>As usual, some of us will be gathering at 1:00pm for a bite to eat before the 2:00pm start.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Look forward to seeing you there!<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=cnr+Brisbane+St+and+tamar+st,+Launceston,+tasmania&amp;sll=-41.439107,147.135751&amp;sspn=0.007818,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-41.433895,147.139442&amp;spn=0.007818,0.014591&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">Google Maps Link<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;gnome.org&#47;">Gnome Website<&#47;a></p>
