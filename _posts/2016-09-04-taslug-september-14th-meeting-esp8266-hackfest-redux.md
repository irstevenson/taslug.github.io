Hello LUGgers!

Things are starting to get warmer, and so TasLUG is venturing away from our
usual meetup at the pub and going back to Hobart Hackerspace for their
Wednesday open night. If you were part of the first ESP8266 Hackfest a few
months ago you should bring your parts and/or project and we'll take it for
another spin.

A few of us have had some success with their NodeMCU devices. Mark has his
integrated with the OpenHAB home automation system. Richard tied his directly
to a 433MHz transmitter, and I connected up an ultrasonic sensor.

We'll demo these projects and help everyone else still having issues getting
their projects going. It will also be a great opportunity to mix with the
Hackerspace members and find out what's going on at the space.

### When

WEDNESDAY September 14th, from 6pm (NOTE: not our usual Thursday!)
