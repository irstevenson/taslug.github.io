<p>Well I can&#39;t seem to get the phpBB over to the newBB so we might have to start that conversation about the chickens again once the forums go live.<br &#47;><br &#47;>&#39;Features&#39; like email notification and the like will be along shortly.<br &#47;><br &#47;>For now I think if I quietly open the door and back away slowly&#8230;</p>
