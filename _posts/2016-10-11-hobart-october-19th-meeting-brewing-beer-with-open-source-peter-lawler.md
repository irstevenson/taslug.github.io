Before October completely runs away from me, let me invite you to this month's
meeting at the Tasman Quartermaster's Arms (note not our regular meeting
place!) on Wednesday 19th October. I was going to have it on Thursday but it's
Show Day and places are closed so I've put it on Wednesday again. However
being the night before a public holiday means you can have a few more drinks.
It's also my birthday so you can come along and call me an old bastard.  
  
We'll be upstairs at the Quartermaster's Arms for dinner, drinks and a
discussion by Peter Lawler on his recent attempts at brewing beer and using
open source to control the brewing process. Come and listen find some great
ideas and the failures along the way. Peter has been using the Beaglebone
Black for a while and has been looking at the real time control units on the
board.  
  
Could I please get an idea of numbers attending - please send me an RSVP by
email.  
  
Tasman Quartermaster's Arms is at 134 Elizabeth St Hobart.  
  
We'll be there from 6pm.
