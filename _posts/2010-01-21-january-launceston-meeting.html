<p>Happy new year everyone!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Edit: Links now fixed.<br &#47;><br &#47;>This month, we will be looking at how to create a 2010 calendar in OpenOffice.org Writer using OpenOffice.org Basic.<br &#47;><br &#47;>This presentation will take the form of a code walkthrough and will assume that you understand basic programming principles such as "variables", "If" statements, "For" and "While" loops, and "Methods", "Functions" or "Subroutines".<br &#47;><br &#47;>Update: Here is a document containing the macro as well as a flow chart to illustrate how the subroutines&#47;functions interact. Remember that to run macros in OpenOffice.org, they need to be enabled from the security settings found in Tools->Options. The macro can be run by going to Tools -> Macros -> Run Macro&#8230;<br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;uploads&#47;calendar_flowchart.svg">http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;uploads&#47;calendar_flowchart.svg<&#47;a><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;uploads&#47;calendar_generator.odt">http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;uploads&#47;calendar_generator.odt<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>If you&#39;re not interested in the programming side of things, we&#39;ll also be touching on recording Macros in OpenOffice.org and there&#39;ll be a neat calendar template at the end for everyone to enjoy.<br &#47;><br &#47;><strong>2:00pm<br &#47;>Saturday 30th January (the last Saturday of the month)<br &#47;>Royal Oak<br &#47;>Launceston<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br &#47;>As usual, some of us will be gathering at 1:00pm for a bite to eat before the 2:00pm start.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Look forward to seeing you there!<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=cnr+Brisbane+St+and+tamar+st,+Launceston,+tasmania&amp;sll=-41.439107,147.135751&amp;sspn=0.007818,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-41.433895,147.139442&amp;spn=0.007818,0.014591&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">Google Maps Link<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.openoffice.org&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.openoffice.org&#47;<&#47;a></p>
