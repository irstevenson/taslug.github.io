We&#39;ll also be taking a quick look at some of the Liberated Pixel Cup art and (if there are many available) game entries.<br &#47;><br &#47;><strong>2:00pm<br &#47;>Saturday 28th July (the last Saturday of the month)<br &#47;>Royal Oak<br &#47;>Launceston<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br &#47;>Aas usual, some of us will be meeting for lunch beforehand at 1:00pm.<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=cnr+Brisbane+St+and+tamar+st,+Launceston,+tasmania&amp;sll=-41.439107,147.135751&amp;sspn=0.007818,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-41.433895,147.139442&amp;spn=0.007818,0.014591&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">Google Maps Link<&#47;a><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;7dfps.org&#47;?projects=flat">FLAT on the 7DFPS website<&#47;a><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;lpc.opengameart.org">Liberated Pixel Cup Website<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>&mdash;&ndash;<br &#47;><br &#47;>Next Hobart meeting: August (date, venue and time TBA)<br &#47;>Following Launceston meeting: 2:00pm August 25th<br &#47;></p>
