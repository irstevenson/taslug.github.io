Hi people! This month's Launceston meeting will feature a talk on the WiFi
Pineapple, a wireless auditing platform running OpenWRT that can be used by
network administrators and auditers to test the security of their own wireless
networks.
In addition to introducing the device and its features, we'll be taking a look
at some possible applications and how they can be used to identify areas for
improvement in network security.
**Where**
Enterprize
22-24 Patterson St

**When**
Saturday 26th August
2:00pm Start

As always, everybody is welcome to come along and join the discussion. Hope to
see you there!
