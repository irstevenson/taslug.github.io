<p>Hi all,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Well SFD is now over until next year and we had an extremely successful day!<br &#47;><br &#47;>I was interviewed on ABC Local radio who  had dedicated their entire computer talkback to Free software and they had a tremendous response from their listeners (in fact, the show went overtime to accommodate them all!).<br &#47;><br &#47;>The displays at the Glenorchy Library were also a tremendous success with at least 50 people attending throughout the day - many coming along after hearing the radio talkback. We got lots of positive response from the public who were very interested in Free software and Linux. <br &#47;><br &#47;>Special thanks go to all the people who helped make the displays a success by talking to people and promoting Free software:<br &#47;>Garry Harradence  (a very successful OpenOffice display).<br &#47;>Neal Schultz<br &#47;>Leah Duncan<br &#47;>Michael Emery<br &#47;>Lucy De Vreeze (our very own Tux!)<br &#47;>Frank<br &#47;><br &#47;>Thanks to everyone for making SFD Hobart a real success!<br &#47;>There are photos of the event <a href="http:&#47;&#47;softwarefreedomday.org&#47;gallery&#47;">here<&#47;a></p>
