<p>With the release of Microsoft&#39;s new Windows operating system (Vista), more and more people are looking for alternatives to Windows for various reasons. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.howtoforge.com&#47;the_perfect_desktop_ubuntu7.04">This tutorial<&#47;a> shows people who are willing to switch to Linux how they can set up a Linux desktop (Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn in this article) that fully replaces their Windows desktop, i.e. that has all software that people need to do the things they do on their Windows desktops. The advantages are clear: you get a secure system without DRM restrictions that runs also on older hardware, and the best thing is: all software comes free of charge.<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.howtoforge.com&#47;the_perfect_desktop_ubuntu7.04">http:&#47;&#47;www.howtoforge.com&#47;the_perfect_desktop_ubuntu7.04<&#47;a></p>
