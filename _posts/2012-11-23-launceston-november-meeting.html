<p>G&#39;day all<br &#47;><br &#47;>Apologies for the super late announcement!<br &#47;><br &#47;>This month, we will be taking a look at the game Monster RPG 2 by Nooskewl, which recently ran a successful crowdfunding campaign to support its open sourcing (along with a commitment for three months worth of bugfixing from the original developer, a comprehensive development wiki, and direct community interaction).<br &#47;><br &#47;>We will be going over the game itself, briefly looking into its codebase, and touching on the crowdfunding campaign.<br &#47;><br &#47;><strong>2:00pm<br &#47;>Saturday 24th November (the last Saturday of the month - Tomorrow!)<br &#47;>Royal Oak<br &#47;>Launceston<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br &#47;>As usual, some of us will be meeting for lunch beforehand at 1:00pm.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Please note that there will be no December meeting in Launceston, and will instead be meeting on the last Saturday of January next year. Thanks to everybody who&#39;s joined us over the last 12 months. It&#39;s been great fun!<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=cnr+Brisbane+St+and+tamar+st,+Launceston,+tasmania&amp;sll=-41.439107,147.135751&amp;sspn=0.007818,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-41.433895,147.139442&amp;spn=0.007818,0.014591&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">Google Maps Link<&#47;a><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.monster-rpg.com&#47;">Monster RPG 2 Website<&#47;a><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.indiegogo.com&#47;monster-rpg-2-open-jrpg-game-engine">The Now-finished Monster RPG 2 Crowdfunding Campaign<&#47;a><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;cheesetalks.twolofbees.com&#47;nooskewl.php">A Recent Interview With Trent From Nooskewl<&#47;a> [size=small](disclaimer: this was done by me!)[&#47;size]<br &#47;>&mdash;&ndash;<br &#47;>Next Hobart meeting: December TBC (possibly a dinner on the 12th)<br &#47;>Following Launceston meeting: 2:00pm January 26th - TBC</p>
