<p>Hi all,<br &#47;><br &#47;>I am absolutely thrilled to announce that Hobart will be the next city to host linux.conf.au 2009!<br &#47;><br &#47;>We have worked very hard this year to prove ourselves ready, willing and able to host this internationally prestigious conference, and are now working even harder to ensure that LCA09 is one fantastic event.  We have big plans for this event, and I guarantee that it will be one to remember.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I extend my warmest regards to the Brisbane team, who also submitted a bid for 2009 - their bid was really top-notch, and offered us some very stiff competition.  There are some great ideas in the pipeline there, and they will definitely be the frontrunner for next year&#39;s bid.  Kudos to the Brisbane team, and I wish you luck for next year&#39;s bid.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Many thanks also to the main bid team who have put in their all so far, in the difficult lead up to Melbourne LCA08 - Ben Powell, Michael Emery, Garry Harradence, Josh Bush, Josh Hesketh, Henry Bush, Victor Medrano (and of course, Leah Duncan - my good self), and the countless others who have offered suggestions, advice, and even just a hand where they can.  353 days to go, guys - keep up the good work!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Volunteers are most welcome to contact the LCA09 coordinators at volunteers@marchsouth.org to offer what support and assistance they can.  Join us to help make this a totally rocking conference!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Our website, until the official handover from the Melbourne team is made, can be found at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.marchsouth.org">http:&#47;&#47;www.marchsouth.org<&#47;a>  <br &#47;><br &#47;>More details to follow!</p>
