Hi people! This month's Launceston meeting will coincide with GovHack,
national event that invites people around Australia to apply their creative
skills to freely available open government data.
We'll be using the opportunity to introduce newcomers to the concepts behind
GovHack, how to go about participating in future events and what Free/Open
Source Software applications and libraries might be useful tools to anybody
looking to create something with one of the many datasets made available by
State governments across the country.

 **Where**
Enterprize
22-24 Patterson St

**When**
Saturday 29th July
2:00pm Start

As always, everybody is welcome to come along and join the discussion. Hope to
see you there!
