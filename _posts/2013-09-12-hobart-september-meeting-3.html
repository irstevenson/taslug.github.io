<p>Welcome to September! I trust you've all recovered from the Federal Election DERP and have your eyes firmly on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;softwarefreedomday.org&#47;" target="_blank">Software Freedom Day<&#47;a> which is less than two weeks away. Here's what's on this month:<br &#47;><br &#47;><b>When:<&#47;b> Thursday, September 19th, 18:00 for an 18:30 start<br &#47;><b>Where:<&#47;b> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;goo.gl&#47;maps&#47;dA2vX" target="_blank">69 Liverpool St, Hobart<&#47;a>. (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;goo.gl&#47;maps&#47;dA2vX" target="_blank">Map<&#47;a>)<br &#47;><br &#47;><b>Agenda:<&#47;b>
<ul>
<li><b>18:00 -<&#47;b> early mingle, chin wagging, etc<&#47;li>
<li><b>18:30 -<&#47;b> Question and<br &#47;>answer session, new Hobart meeting venue, Internet privacy discussion <&#47;li>
<li><b>19:00 - <&#47;b><b>Hacking<br &#47;>for Freedom: A TasLUG Sprint <&#47;b><br &#47;>   As a prelude to Software Freedom Day, we'll be discussing and perhaps even making a start on contributing to a Free Software project of our choosing.<br &#47;><br &#47;>   <a href="http:&#47;&#47;owncloud.org&#47;" target="_blank">ownCloud<&#47;a> has been touted as one project to work on, to help those who<br &#47;>want an NSA free cloud.<br &#47;><br &#47;>   <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.libreoffice.org&#47;" target="_blank">LibreOffice<&#47;a> has also been floated as another option, particularly as a demo for writing python &#47; javascript macros.<br &#47;><br &#47;>   If you're looking to get a start in contributing to Free Software, this night will be a great opportunity.<br &#47;><br &#47;>   If you're an experienced hacker, you can provide mentoring and leadership to those following in your footsteps.<br &#47;><br &#47;>   If like me, you can't programme your way out of a paper if statement, it's great learning opportunity.<br &#47;><br &#47;>
<li><b>20:00 -<&#47;b> Meeting end. Many people go to the Brunswick for dinner.<&#47;li><&#47;ul><br &#47;><u><b>September:<&#47;b><&#47;u><br &#47;><b>21st -<&#47;b> Software Freedom Day - Hobart and Launceston events<br &#47;><b>28th -<&#47;b> Launceston meeting<br &#47;><u><b>October:<&#47;b><&#47;u><br &#47;><b>17th -<&#47;b> Matthew Oakes - grok.art programming and creativity<br &#47;><b>26th -<&#47;b> Launceston meeting<br &#47;><u><b>November:<&#47;b><&#47;u><br &#47;><b>21st -<&#47;b> Josh Hesketh - Continuous integration testing against real datasets for Openstack<br &#47;><b>30th -<&#47;b> Launceston meeting<br &#47;><u><b>December:<&#47;b><&#47;u><br &#47;><b>12th -<&#47;b> Hobart Christmas Party<br &#47;></p>
