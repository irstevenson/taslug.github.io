<p>For anybody like myself who currently has to contend with running Valve&#39;s games under Wine, the announcement (which is a footnote in the following article) is fantastic news!<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.telegraph.co.uk&#47;technology&#47;apple&#47;7715209&#47;Steam-for-Mac-goes-live.html">http:&#47;&#47;www.telegraph.co.uk&#47;technology&#47;apple&#47;7715209&#47;Steam-for-Mac-goes-live.html<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>Phoronix have a bit more detail for anyone keen on some backstory:<br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.phoronix.com&#47;scan.php?page=article&item=valve_steam_announcement&num=1">http:&#47;&#47;www.phoronix.com&#47;scan.php?page=article&item=valve_steam_announcement&num=1<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>For anybody who&#39;s scratching their heads wondering why hot water vapour is relevant to Linux, Steam is a content delivery&#47;DRM (but that&#39;s a discussion for another time) system that is very popular amongst Windows gamers and also provides an alternative distribution network for independent developers&#47;publishers who don&#39;t have the resources to compete in the retail market. After many, many years of a "There&#39;s no Linux market" attitude from the game development industry as a whole, the &#39;industry recognition&#39; that this announcement carries will have a significant impact on the way that end users and developers perceive and approach Linux.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Whether you care about games or not, this is Good News.</p>
