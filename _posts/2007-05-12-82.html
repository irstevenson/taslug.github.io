<p>Hi All,<br &#47;><br &#47;>I&#39;ve re-posted this from the LA mailing list. There are a couple of things of interest for TasLUG including an upcoming conference of LUGs in June and a trip to Tassie from  a Linux Australia rep.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;><br &#47;>Czaxx.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>Hi all,<br &#47;><br &#47;>As some of you know, the Linux Australia committee had a face to face<br &#47;>meeting in Melbourne a few weeks ago to freshen our perspectives, get<br &#47;>prepared for LA activities this year and to also move forward on the long<br &#47;>term planning for LA. It was a great meeting and we covered a lot of ground.<br &#47;>The minutes are available at:<br &#47;><br &#47;>    <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.linux.org.au&#47;Ctte&#47;MeetingNotes20070415">http:&#47;&#47;wiki.linux.org.au&#47;Ctte&#47;MeetingNotes20070415<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;d certainly appreciate feedback.<br &#47;>Jon has a few things to send through to linux-aus soon including some<br &#47;>proposed constitutional ammendments for LA to have more flexibility in its<br &#47;>membership model and to better define the role of the committee amongst<br &#47;>other ideas.<br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;re going to make sure we are reporting here about LA activities more<br &#47;>often. My question for you all is how do you see LA in the future? Hopefully<br &#47;>not sponsoring cars in overseas races ;) We currently have a number of<br &#47;>sub-committees (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;linux.org.au&#47;About&#47;Sub-Committees">http:&#47;&#47;linux.org.au&#47;About&#47;Sub-Committees<&#47;a>) so check them out<br &#47;>and see how you might help out, or perhaps you have a fantastic idea that<br &#47;>could be done as an LA project? Propose your own sub-ctte :)<br &#47;><br &#47;>For me, Linux Australia has always been about:<br &#47;><br &#47;>    1) bringing the community together<br &#47;>    2) supporting our community<br &#47;>    3) strength in numbers<br &#47;>    4) achieving great things for FOSS in Australia!<br &#47;>    5) ensuring the community voice is heard<br &#47;><br &#47;>Linux Australia is a great tool for our entire community, so the more people<br &#47;>that get involved, the stronger it is.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Oh, and great work by James Purser on the new website! There is still some<br &#47;>work to do, so please be patient and post your feedback here. We already<br &#47;>know about the jobs page and the membership page and are working on them<br &#47;>now.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Cheers,<br &#47;>Pia</p>
