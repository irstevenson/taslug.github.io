<p>G'day again everyoneApologies once again for the late announcement. The excuse this time is that SFD did too good a job of occupying everybody's attention.Same place, same time. We haven't quite finalised what kind of talk we'll give. It's quite possible that this meeting will be a, "Woah, SFD is over!," or as a fallback, I might talk about the techniques I used with creating the fliers and posters we used on the day.<b>2:00pm27th September (Last Saturday of the month)Royal OakLaunceston<&#47;b>As per usual, some of us will be gathering at 1:00pm to have a bite to eat before the 2 o'clock start.I look forward to seeing everyone who can make it![url=http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=cnr+Brisbane+St+and+tamar+st,+Launceston,+tasmania&sll=-41.439107,147.135751&sspn=0.007818,0.014591&ie=UTF8&ll=-41.433895,147.139442&spn=0.007818,0.014591&z=16&iwloc=addr]Google Maps Link[&#47;url]</p>
