<li>[b]19:00 - [&#47;b][b]Michael Gissing - Using [url=http:&#47;&#47;www.opendcp.org&#47;]OpenDCP[&#47;url] to Create Cinema Quality Footage[&#47;b]The software enables people to take a finished video with audio and bundle into the specific format for playing in cinemas. Digital cinemas have reached an international standard regarding file and disk formatting. Until this software was released, custom software to create this format was expensive.The DCP format also specifies ext3 disk formatting as digital cinemas servers are all Linux based. Cinemaprojection also uses a specific colour profile and file wrappers. This software takes a video and does the colour space conversion and codec and wraps it in an mxf file format, a simple but not trivial conversion that has until recently been complicated and expensive.Open DCP was developed by a software person with a part ownership of a cinema who was frustrated by complicated expensive software to make compliant files. In the talk I will discuss briefly the history behind digital cinema, the efforts to adopt reliable video servers based on Linux and the technical differences between the various colour profiles required by different display monitors or projectors and how that all needs to be translatable into an industry standard file and XML bundle that will reproduce accurately a colour graded master in cinemas world wide.[img]http:&#47;&#47;www.opendcp.org&#47;images&#47;opendcp-logo.png[&#47;img]
