<p>G&#39;day all<br &#47;><br &#47;>We&#39;re pleased to announce that we&#39;re going to go with a theme for SFD this year, and that theme is "Bring a friend".<br &#47;><br &#47;>So many of the people we know and interact with have little awareness of the role, significance and potential of Free&#47;Open Source Software. This year at Software Freedom Day, we&#39;d like to see as many new people as possible and help you help them understand why Free&#47;Open Source Software is worth being passionate about.<br &#47;><br &#47;>When you&#39;re encouraging your friends to come along, an important part to remember is that we&#39;re not trying to change minds, we&#39;re trying to open them and give them the freedom of choice in a relaxed, fun environment. <br &#47;><br &#47;>Who knows, perhaps someone you know may go home and try out some Free&#47;Open Source Software. Maybe they&#39;ll even stop sending you emails with attachments in proprietary formats.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>Press Release<br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;uploads&#47;SFD_2010_PR.pdf">http:&#47;&#47;taslug.scriptforge.org&#47;uploads&#47;SFD_2010_PR.pdf<&#47;a></p>
