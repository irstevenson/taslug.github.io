<p>... the meeting you've all been waiting for!  We will be meeting at the Hotel Soho at 124 Davey St Hobart at 7 pm on Thursday 20th March for a general meet and greet, with drinks and a bite to eat (they've got some pretty good wedges and burgers for anyone looking for something simple).We will be discussing the upcoming linux.conf.au 2009; future plans for TasLUG in general, and taking expressions of interest for assistance with making this all happen.Hope to see you there.<a href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?q=124%20Davey%20Street++Hobart+++" target="_blank">[Google Maps]<&#47;a>Cheers,Leah.[Edit - might help if I put a date in there somewhere... ;-) ][Edit 2 - Could you please RSVP to taslug@gmail.com so I can make sure there's enough space for everyone!  Thanks.]</p>
