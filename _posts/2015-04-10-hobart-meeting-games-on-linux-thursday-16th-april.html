<p>The past month has flown by and this month's meeting is a little earlier than usual (still on the 3rd Thursday). This month we want you to bring your Linux gaming laptop or gaming rig and demo your favourite game on Linux.</p>
<p>With the release of now over 1000 titles on Steam as well as a plethora of sources for games on Linux it's time for us to share how we use our Linux desktops as entertainment devices! Hook your box up to the projector and give us a quick demo play of a couple of your favourites.</p>
<p><strong>When<&#47;strong>: Thursday 16th April 2015 from 6pm.</p>
<p><strong>Where<&#47;strong>: Hotel SOHO, 124 Davey St, Hobart<br />
