<p>Hi LUGgers,</p>
<p>So the keysigning event last night went well. The massive super beef<br />
schnitzel defeated yet another of us. Fingerprints were exchanged, IDs were<br />
verified, with about 10 people turning up.</p>
<p>Since a couple of people didn't have fingerprints to hand out last night,<br />
we will be making every Hobart TasLUG meeting an open keysigning event, so<br />
new keys to add to our web of trust will always be welcome.</p>
<p>Towards the end we tried out TAILS on my USB stick. The curse of the live demo<br />
threatened when it didn't detect my wireless but on second reboot it all<br />
started to work. Then we tried out Kali Linux which is the other distro I<br />
keep on my USB stick, and while there was some mocking at the automatic<br />
Gnome as root on startup, the included network analysis and development tools<br />
included on the distro are impressive.</p>
<p>So, prepare yourselve for Software Freedom Day next month - Saturday 20th<br />
September at Lenah Valley Hall!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Scott Bragg<br />
