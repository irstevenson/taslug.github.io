Hi LUGgers! Swim to the high ground at Hotel SOHO this month to talk about
automating some of your development workflows with the BuildBot CI Server.
It's a CI written in Python that's pretty easy to configure.

## Where: Hotel SoHo, Davey St, Hobart

## Agenda:

  * 6pm - Arrive, grab a drink, order some food
  * 6.30pm - Tech support and cool stuff
  * 7pm - Automate with BuildBotCI - Scott Bragg
