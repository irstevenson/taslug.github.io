<p>Hi everyone,<br &#47;><br &#47;>The Tassie LCA09 Team would like to thank our Ghosts of Conferences Past - Stewart Smith, Donna Benjamin, Peter Lieverdink, Rusty and Alli Russell, Avi Miller, Michael Davies, Anthony Towns, and Steve Walsh -  for a rocking weekend of fun, food and serious fact finding.  A good time was had by all, and we've all come out of it wiser, and ready for action.  Still lots of work to be done - we'll have plenty to talk about at the next TasLUG meeting, and probably lots of work for anyone who wants to take up the challenge!<br &#47;><br &#47;>There's some great photos on Michael Davies' blog, and Donna had some lovely things to say about our upcoming conference.  They can be found here:<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;kattekrab.livejournal.com&#47;41726.html" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;kattekrab.livejournal.com&#47;41726.html<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.michaeldavies.org&#47;weblog&#47;tech&#47;linux-australia&#47;lca2009&#47;ghosts-2009.html" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;www.michaeldavies.org&#47;weblog&#47;tech&#47;linux-australia&#47;lca2009&#47;ghosts-2009.html<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>There'll be a meeting announcement in the next 24 hours - stay tuned!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Leah.<br &#47;></p>
