<p>Just a reminder that there is a meeting in Hobart to discuss our LCA 2009 bid at 1:30 pm tomorrow at the Republic Bar beer garden (out the back).<br &#47;><br &#47;>We are preparing for a familiarisation visit from an LA committee member, Steve Walsh, in the next week or two, and new faces and ideas are definitely welcome. Come along if you&#39;d like to be part of the LCA magic and throw around a few last minute ideas to make our LCA bid shine!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Saturday 8th December, 1:30 pm<br &#47;>Republic Bar Beer Garden - look for the penguin!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Hope to see you there!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Leah.</p>
