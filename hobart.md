We meet on the third Thursday of every month. Currently we are meeting at 
the home of the Hobart Makers, which is in one of the buildings next to
the St Johns Church in Newtown.

The venue is located at the end of St Johns Road, New Town.

Our meetings start from 6pm. Main talks/events do not usually start until 7pm.
This allows people to arrive, chat, demo new gear, ask for technical 
support, etc.

The Hobart meeting coordinator is [Scott Bragg](jsbragg@scriptforge.org)
