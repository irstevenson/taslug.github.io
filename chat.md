## Matrix Chat Room

Head over to the [TasLUG Matrix room](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#taslug:matrix.org) in your browser.
There are also mobile clients available in the app store of your device (search for Riot IM).

Matrix is a new federated chat protocol that runs over HTTP so it is very easy to write bridges, bots and
other applications for. Apart from a really nice chat interface provided by the Riot IM app, many of us
use Matrix because:

* It is a federated system so you can run your own server and bridges
* It supports end to end encryption (in private chats and some rooms)
* Has VoIP voice and video capabilities
* Can share images and links
* Bridges to FreeNode and other IRC networks
* Bridges to other chat platforms
* Other apps available such as weeChat

## IRC

TasLUG has a long running IRC channel, #taslug on the Freenode IRC network. The TasLUG IRC channel is bridged to the
Matrix room above so you only need to join Matrix or IRC and you will be in the same room.

Grab your favourite IRC client:

* irssi
* xchat

And connect to chat.freenode.net then join #taslug
