The Tasmanian Linux Users Group promotes the use of Linux as well as Free, 
Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) in general. 

We have monthly meetings in both the North and South of the state.

We are a friendly group of hackers and makers that use open source and open
hardware in our work and play. Our monthly meetings provide a focus of what
each of us are currently working on and learning about. We also chat
frequently online with our Matrix/IRC room and Mailing List

We are a LUG that is a subcommittee of [Linux Australia](http://linux.org.au).
