Our mailing list is provided by [Linux Australia](http://linux.org.au).

You can join the list at [this page](http://lists.linux.org.au/mailman/listinfo/taslug) 

The mailing list archives are available from [here](http://lists.linux.org.au/pipermail/taslug/)

If you are interested in coming to our meetups please join the mailing list as the latest meetups are promoted on the
list. The list is also for general Linux and open source discussion, so if you have a question, fire it at the list
and we might be able to help. Some people keep some old hardware lying around so if you need something archiac, you
might find it by asking the list.
